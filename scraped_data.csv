Tanzania - Local Government Support Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) covers an operation implemented
over the period FY05-FY12. The Tanzania Local Government Support Project (LGSP)
was approved by the Board on November 30, 2004, became effective on April 13, 2005
and closed on June 30, 2012. The project's development objectives were to: (a)
strengthen fiscal decentralization and improve accountability in the use of local
government resources and in the management of intergovernmental transfer systems; and
(b) increase access to infrastructure and services in the Unplanned Areas of Dar es
Salaam and improve revenue performance for sustainable operation and maintenance.
The Report presents findings based on the review of the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD), the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR), Implementation Status
and Results Reports (ISRs) and other relevant materials. In addition to project documents,
information for this assessment was obtained from interviews conducted during an IEG
mission in Tanzania in November 2014 with government officials, project supervisors,
local government authorities, members of the donor community, and Bank staff.

The Black Box of Governmental Learning: The Learning Spiral- A Concept to Organize Learning in Governments, PDF file,"Little is known about how governments learn best or what exactly makes them change their behavior in a targeted way. When governments perform poorly, the consequences are wasted resources; undelivered services; and denial of social, legal, and economic protection for citizens, especially the poor. Thus, it is important that governments learn from past practices to avoid mistakes and to adopt successful practices from others, and continuously acquire new knowledge to make them more efficient and relevant. Because the process of learning in governmental settings is considered hard to execute and conceptualize, it is referred to as a black box. The Black Box of Governmental Learning suggests several practical and methodological steps and introduces the model of the Learning Spiral to facilitate such learning.

	used to systematically evaluate all government programs every three to five years; these
	evaluation findings were used heavily by officials, ministers and the Cabinet in the annual budget
	process. The uses of these findings included the policy advice prepared by departments including
	the preparation of ministersâ new policy proposals and departmentsâ savings options submitted to

Implementing a Government-wide Monitoring and Evaluation System in South Africa, Web Resource,"This paper outlines the process of implementing a government-wide monitoring and
	evaluation (GWM&E) system in South Africa. The first section sketches the context that
	created the impetus for establishing such a system. This context is clearly shaping the
	evolution of the system and influencing its longer-term sustainability. The second section
	outlines the various stages of conceptualizing and implementing the GWM&E system,
	which is currently very much a âwork in progress.â Key components of the South African
	GWM&E framework are described in detail, such as: the policy platform upon which it is
	based, the specific M&E products and their uses, as well as the major actors. The creation
	of a dedicated Ministry of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (PME) within the
	Presidentâs Office in 2009 signaled a new phase in the development trajectory of M&E
	systems in the South African public sector. The new ministry introduced a Policy Paper
	on Improving Government Outcomes in Parliament in 2009, outlining an approach. The
	policy position draws on the existing GWM&E system and expands its policy reach by
	introducing a specific focus on performance and monitoring at the level of politically

"In South Africa, using evaluation to improve government effectiveness", Web Resource,"Since 2009 the Government of South Africa has put a major emphasis on monitoring and evaluation (M&E) as a way of transforming public sector service delivery. The key champion is the newly established Department of Performance M&E (DPME), created in the Presidency. Our first priority has been to get the government to focus on a limited number of strategic priorities. We have also now developed tools for assessing the management performance of government departments, hands-on physical monitoring of services around the country through unannounced visits, and we have established an evaluation system. Two approaches currently being developed are around citizen-based monitoring and the monitoring of the performance of local government. A lot has been accomplished in the two and a half years since we were established. But what are some of the emerging lessons around building evaluation capacity?

In research undertaken by DPME 54 percent of departments reported that problems were not seen as an opportunity to learn, and 39 percent saw our work as a way of policing and controlling staff. So how do we introduce evaluation, and the use of evidence as something which will assist in getting better development outcomes in an environment where M&E is for compliance, and vertical accountability rather than managers using the information to improve their own performance?

A lot of what DPME has been doing is about supply – finding better ways to deliver better evidence about how government is performing, for Cabinet, for Parliament, and ultimately for the public. In terms of evaluations we have been building system elements, such as national evaluation plans, guidelines, standards, competences as well as developing a suite of training courses, training 300 government staff per year. Our core approach, however, is that learning happens through doing. We work with departments in evaluation processes, building both their and our capacity. This is a long-term endeavour.

We have recently started working more with the demand side of the equation. We have been building the understanding and awareness of the parliamentary committee that we report to – the Standing Committee on Appropriations - with workshops, international study tours and regular reporting. We also have been undertaking training with Members of Parliament, as well as parliamentary researchers, so that they are able to use our M&E evidence. There is a huge opportunity here for parliamentary committees to use evaluations to inform their oversight processes.

We also know that we need senior managers to support and use evaluations. Our system asks departments to submit proposals for evaluations so that they will want to use the findings. It also requires departments to produce improvement plans once evaluations are completed to ensure the findings are followed up. We have started running training for Director Generals and Deputy Director Generals to build awareness of why evidence is important.  Of course, DPME is also working with Cabinet with the aim of improving the evidence available to it for decision making. Our hope is that this will stimulate Cabinet to demand better evidence. The President is also using M&E evidence to appraise ministers.

It is critical for Parliament and the executive to see that they are on the same mission, and to find ways to work together effectively, using evaluation evidence to inform demands for improvements in performance. With partners in Mexico and Ghana, DPME organized a seven country roundtable in November about the use of evidence that also involved participants from Peru, Uganda, Benin and India. Members of Parliament and senior public servants were encouraged to attend. Those that did found it very powerful, and this is clearly a partnership we need to promote going forward.

This is a major journey we are on, and we have to build this ship as we sail, but already we have 38 evaluations completed, underway, or about to start, and hopefully many of these will help to inform how we can improve what government does and the impact it  has on citizens.

Ethiopia - Urban Local Government Development Project, Web Resource ,"This is the Project Performance Assessment Report for the Urban Local Government Development Project (ULGDP) in Ethiopia, which was approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on May 29, 2008, and closed on December 31, 2014. The project’s development objective was to support improved performance in the planning, delivery, and sustained provision of priority municipal services and infrastructure by urban local governments across the country.

Ratings for Urban Local Government Development Project are as follows: Outcome was satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was negligible to low, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons from the project include: (i) There is a trade‐off between scope and development outcomes in municipal operations that use performance‐based grants. It is critical to ensure that funding is sufficient to both incentivize behavior at the city level and offer a meaningful level of technical assistance. (ii) A one‐size‐fits‐all approach is ineffective in urban development projects that target multiple cities at various stages of development. (iii) Performance‐based grants should be considered as a preferred method of intermediating intergovernmental fiscal resources to urban local governments in the context of emerging urban systems. (iv) Promoting autonomous decision making at the city level although ensuring that operational rules and supervision are in place is a necessary condition to ensuring the intended use of funds in municipal finance projects. (v) Urban development projects need to balance targeting core city administrative functions as well as improving city management and planning competencies.

Clarification: Media Reporting on the Findings of the Independent Evaluation Group on the World Bank Group Program in Mozambique, Web Resource,"WASHINGTON - July 14, 2023 – In its report, The World Bank Group in Mozambique, Fiscal Years 2008–21, the Independent Evaluation Group neither concludes nor implies that the World Bank Group is in any way responsible for the actions of the Government of Mozambique. The report is solely focused on the actions of the World Bank Group, and is not an assessment of either the policies or actions of the Government of Mozambique. The report does not hold the World Bank Group responsible for any actions taken by the Government of Mozambique. This is the case with the 2016 financial scandal now commonly referred to as ‘Hidden Debts.’ The causes of this scandal are for the Government of Mozambique to investigate.

The report of the Independent Evaluation Group aims to draw lessons from this period to improve the support of the World Bank Group to both the people and Government of Mozambique. Two of the key findings of the report are that technical support for public financial and debt management should include a focus on governance risks in contexts characterized by powerful groups with strong vested interests, and that diagnostics are critical to inform reform programs but they require deliberate and coordinated operational follow-up. The report found that World Bank support for good governance was constant through the evaluation period, though the nature of this support changed along with changes to the country context, such as the discovery of gas deposits in 2010 and the uncovering of the hidden debt crisis in 2016. These findings and lessons are to inform future World Bank Group support to Mozambique and do not imply that the World Bank Group could in any way have influenced the decisions and actions that led to the ‘Hidden Debts’ scandal, as reported by media following the presentation of the findings of the report at a workshop at the Montebelo Indy Maputo Congress Hotel in Maputo on July 12, 2023. The causes of the scandal are for the Government of Mozambique alone to determine.

Rwanda - Urban Infrastructure and City Management Project (UICMP), Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews the Rwanda Urban Infrastructure and City Management Project (UICMP). The project was approved on November 10, 2005 and became effective on June 2, 2006. The project’s original closing date of March 31, 2009, was extended by nine months to December 31, 2009. The project was financed by an International Development Association (IDA) grant ($20 million) and a Professional Human Resource Development grant ($0.46 million), and contributions from the government of Rwanda ($2.6 million). The Nordic Development Fund provided parallel financing ($6.4 million). The project development objective (PDO) was to increase access to urban infrastructure and services in the primary city of Kigali and the two secondary cities of Butare and Ruhengeri through physical investment and upgrading and improved management tools.

Ratings for this project are as follows: Outcome was satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Main lessons from this operation are as follows: (i) The World Bank’s absence in a sector creates knowledge and implementation gaps for both World Bank and client, requiring significant catch-up transaction costs. (ii) Using a delegated management agency to address the weak implementation capacity of local governments requires a focus on building such capacity and a clear exit strategy to ensure long-term sustainability. (iii) To maximize learning from pilot project components, their lessons should be documented and disseminated to inform the future work of the World Bank and government.

Madagascar - Second Phase of Governance and Institutional Development Project, Web Resource,"Ratings for the Planning and

            Timor-Leste were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the
            risk to development outcome was negligible to low, the Bank
            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower
            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons
            learned included: consistency and stability of personnel are
            important. In this case, turnover of both
            consultants/advisors and task team leaders negatively
            impacted project performance at various stages of
            implementation. A modest initial project scope, producing
            quick and demonstrable wins, can be preferable to early
            ambition. In this case, the complexity of planned activities
            and results matrix overwhelmed staff with limited capacity,
            necessitating restructuring to streamline. Deliberate and
            focused attention to balancing the implementation and
            capacity building roles of external technical advisors is
            critical for long-term success. In this case, the advisors
            frequently assumed direct implementation roles in response

Esclarecimento: Reportagem da Mídia sobre as Conclusões do Grupo de Avaliação Independente sobre o Programa do Grupo do Banco Mundial em Moçambique, Web Resource,"WASHINGTON - 14 de Julho de 2023 – No seu relatório, O Grupo do Banco Mundial em Moçambique, Exercícios Fiscais de 2008–21, o Grupo de Avaliação Independente não conclui nem implica que o Grupo do Banco Mundial seja de alguma forma responsável pelas acções do Governo de Moçambique . O relatório centra-se exclusivamente nas acções do Grupo do Banco Mundial e não é uma avaliação das políticas ou acções do Governo de Moçambique. O relatório não responsabiliza o Grupo Banco Mundial por quaisquer acções tomadas pelo Governo de Moçambique. Este é o caso do escândalo financeiro de 2016, comumente conhecido por 'Dívidas Ocultas'. As causas deste escândalo devem ser investigadas pelo Governo de Moçambique.

O relatório do Grupo de Avaliação Independente pretende tirar lições deste período para melhorar o apoio do Grupo do Banco Mundial, tanto ao povo, como ao Governo de Moçambique. Duas das principais conclusões do relatório são que o apoio técnico para a gestão das finanças públicas e da dívida deve incluir um foco nos riscos de governação em contextos caracterizados por grupos poderosos com fortes interesses investidos, e que os diagnósticos são essenciais para informar os programas de reforma, mas exigem acompanhamento operacional coordenado. O relatório constatou que o apoio do Banco Mundial à boa governação foi constante durante o período em avaliação, embora a natureza desse apoio tenha mudado em consonância com as mudanças no contexto do país, como a descoberta de depósitos de gás em 2010 e a revelação da crise da dívida oculta em 2016. Estas constatações e lições destinam-se a informar o futuro apoio do Grupo Banco Mundial a Moçambique, e não implicam que o Grupo Banco Mundial possa de alguma forma ter influenciado as decisões e acções que levaram ao escândalo das 'Dívidas Ocultas', conforme reportado pelos meios de comunicação após a apresentação das conclusões do relatório durante um workshop realizado no Montebelo Indy Maputo Congress Hotel em Maputo, no dia 12 de Julho de 2023. As causas do escândalo das ‘Dívidas Ocultas’ são da responsabilidade exclusiva do Governo de Moçambique.

Rwanda - Quality of Decentralized Service Delivery Support Development Policy Operation, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses the Rwanda Quality of Decentralized Service Delivery Support Development Policy Operation, in the amount of $50 million, which was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on May 14, 2013 and closed as scheduled on June 30, 2014. The purpose of the PPAR is to examine the extent to which this development policy operation achieved its relevant objectives and the sustainability of outcomes after project closure. In addition to its accountability and lesson-learning functions, the PPAR provided input for IEG’s Country Program Evaluation for Rwanda for fiscal years 2009–17. It will also serve the purpose of providing input to an upcoming IEG thematic evaluation on strengthening subnational governments.

Ratings for this project are as follows: World Bank’s financial contribution was satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Government performance was satisfactory. The following lessons are drawn from the design and implementation of the program: (i) Strong government ownership and leadership of the reform agenda are important drivers of successful development policy financing. (ii) Rollout of an IFMIS at the local government level can serve as a useful catalyst and vehicle for enhancing local capacity.  (iii) Flexibility, agility, and strategic acumen on the World Bank’s part can play a valuable role in resolving a financing impasse that threatens to jeopardize development gains. (iv) In designing a DPO, there may be a trade-off between speed of response and value-added in terms of leveraging reforms.

Nigeria - State Education Sector Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report evaluates the Nigeria State Education Sector Project (2008 to 2011). The project objective was to improve the quality of basic education in targeted Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the participating States--Kano and Kaduna States (north west zone), and Kwara State (north central zone). It focused particularly on girls' participation as measured by improved learning conditions--this key performance indicator was subsequently changed--and increased transition and completion rates for boys and girls in 21 targeted LGAs. The project selected the three States based on their demonstrated commitment to the education sector, quality of sector plan, and poor educational indicators. Within the States, LGAs were selected using criteria such as poverty, readiness and willingness of key officials to implement reforms, enrollment rate in basic education, per capita public spending on primary and secondary education, and absence of other externally funded projects. Gender disparity was another criterion. The focus on girls' participation and improving quality was highly relevant for each of the States. The project's objective is also highly relevant to each State's Education Sector Plan, which aims to accelerate progress toward the key education Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It also aligns with the Federal Ministry of Education Ten Year Strategic Plan to promote delivery of quality education, as well as the establishment of quality assurance procedures. The project's outcome is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Based on the experience of this project, several lessons can be drawn, (i) Learning and sustainability of pilot activities are limited when there is an absence of clear design, an explicit mechanism for evaluating, and a sufficient implementation time frame. Initiating the Conditional-Cash Transfer (CCT) program targeted for girls during the last year of the project provided insufficient time to implement the pilot. As well, it is difficult to determine the benefits and effectiveness of the pilot Early Childhood Development (ECD) activities, given the absence of the monitoring and evaluation system and implementation plan. (ii) Setting up a monitoring and evaluation system takes more time than is often recognized. An overly complex system was designed and replaced with a simplified one. In environments with low capacity, understanding the critical data needs of the government is essential, as well as the amount of technical assistance that will be required. (iii) A prior unsuccessful project can result in learning, but it depends upon an agreed-to understanding of performance issues. This project avoided some of the shortcomings of the predecessor Bank-funded project, the Universal Basic Education Project. (iv) Even with a State-focused project, the involvement of the Federal Ministry of Education is critical given its central role in policy. The difficulties related to the Federal implementation in the Universal Basic Education project were not fully understood. During preparation, instead of designing approaches to overcome the challenges experienced by the Federal Ministry of Education with the Universal Basic Education Project, the Federal role was minimal. This reduced the buy-in by the Federal Ministry of Education and likelihood of replicating project activities in other States. (v) Improving inputs into learning needs to be accompanied by defining and addressing quality requirements in terms of minimum standards for student learning. While this project improved the inputs and physical conditions for learning, these may not translate into improved student learning, as the key issue of teachers' capacities was insufficiently addressed by the project.

Albania - Secondary and Local Roads Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses the development effectiveness of the Secondary and Local Roads Project in Albania approved in 2008. The project development objective was to improve access to essential services and economic markets via the provision of all-weather roads for the resident population in the rural areas of Albania. This would be achieved through reconstructing selected secondary and local roads; building the competencies of the implementation agency Albanian Development Fund (ADF); building an asset management system for the secondary and local road networks; and improving capacity in the local community for maintenance.

Ratings for the Secondary and Local Roads Project are as follows: Outcome was satisfactory, Risk to development outcome as moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons from the project include: (i) Implementing a successful multidonor programmatic approach to sector development requires the combination of government commitment with credible planning and common rules of engagement. (ii) Concentrating competencies within one agency may frustrate future decentralization of responsibilities. (iii) In the absence of need-based and credible linkages to resource allocation, a road asset management system may not get sufficient traction.

Colombia - Programmatic Productive and Sustainable Cities Development Policy Loans, Web Resource ,"This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the programmatic Productive and Sustainable Cities Development Policy Loans (DPLs; P130972) intended to support the strengthening of the government of Colombia’s policy framework on productive, sustainable, and inclusive cities. The DPL’s objective was and remains highly relevant to the national policy and sector context, and most of the project’s prior actions were substantially designed to fulfill the aims of the DPL reform areas. However, the alignments of some prior actions show weaknesses, especially in the area of achieving more sustainable cities, and with the definition of outcomes and their measurement.

Ratings for this project are as follows: outcome was satisfactory, risk to development outcome was modest, bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower performance was satisfactory. Several lessons emerged from this assessment of the Colombian DPL series: (i) Tacit assumptions that additional fiscal outlays will be forthcoming to support prior actions in development policy operations (DPOs) can create risks to the sustainability of policy reforms. (ii) When designing prior actions that require local-level implementation, it is important to consider municipal capacity and the time required to enact local-level reforms. (iii) In designing multisectoral DPOs with many prior actions across sectors, which include local implementation requirements, municipal capacity building may be required. (iv) In the context of multisector DPOs, it is critical that prior actions be directly linked to results indicators so a clear line of sight and envisioned impact is identified ex ante, thus supporting a strong design at entry.

Ratings for the First Municipal Development and Decentralization Project were as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was low; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the Second Municipal Development and Decentralization Project were as follows: outcome was satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was low; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included from the project: in providing assistance for the reform of any sector municipal in this case-Bank and Borrower need also to help ensure that information systems are adequate for implementing the reforms and for monitoring progress. In the case of these three projects, information on municipal finances and on the economic performance of sub-project investments was sparse. Georgia's situation in this regard could be improved by the greater use of municipal experiences of other countries. Political volatility provides unusual challenges and opportunities for Bank supervision. It calls for more thorough documentation than normal, detailing all actions agreed between Bank and Borrower. It also requires greater oversight of project financial management. In the case of Georgia, it did provide opportunities for the Bank to act as valued and stable interlocutor in times of change. Major political and economic transition, while offering opportunities for reform, may slow down progress with municipal reform in particular, as national governments work to establish the effectiveness of their central control. When municipal management is very weak overall, it makes sense to work first with stronger and creditworthy municipalities that are most likely to succeed. In Georgia, the national government could recognize and foster these municipalities as models of good practice and sources for inspiration and technical assistance for others to learn from.",Country :  Georgia,Content Type : Reports,"June 23, 2008

            outcome although a portion (about 20 percent) of its initial
            funding was canceled. The following were the lessons
            learned: Counterpart funding should be significant to ensure
            increased ownership and sustainability of this type of
            project. The effectiveness of the project management unit
            depends on the PMU's capacity to access key
            decisionmakers in both the national development planning
            agency and the executing agencies, as well as the strength
            of its operational staff. Free-standing and open-ended
            technical assistance projects need to emphasize 1) rapidity
            of review and approval process of requests for financing and
            2) agreement at appraisal on a series of terms of reference
            and project development packages. Technical assistance
            projects involving executing agents/decentralized units
            should focus more on these units. Intermediate results from
            project components to overall project objectives (from
            implementing studies to concluding contracts) must be made
            clear to them from the beginning. Specific guidelines must
            be provided by the PMU to such agencies to avoid having to
            reject requests for financing. Good supervision and
            continuity in the supervision team is critical for
            satisfactory project implementation. The size and skill mix

Zambia - Public Sector Management Program Support Project, Web Resource ,"This PPAR evaluates the World Bank's Public Sector Management Program Support
Project (PSMP-SP) for the second phase of the public service reform program in Zambia.
The project was approved on May 1, 2006, and closed on June 30, 2012, 18 months
behind schedule. The World Bank, through the International Development Association
(IDA), provided a credit of US$30 million. Additional parallel financing of US$70
million was provided for the program via a sector wide approach from a number of other
development partners.
Zambia is a landlocked country that is generously endowed with natural resources and
has benefitted from rapid economic growth since the early 2000s. Benefits of growth
were however narrowly distributed with poverty remaining widespread and many service
delivery indicators lagging behind expectations, in part due to ineffective government
intervention. With the economic position deteriorating in more recent years following the
collapse of the copper price (which halved between 2011 and 2016), the government's
fiscal space narrowed making the effective use of public resources all the more important.
In this environment, the project's overarching objective of making public service delivery
institutions and processes more effective and efficient was critical. To that end, the
project supported two government programs: (1) the Public Financial Management and
Accountability Program (PFMAP) aimed at strengthening the mobilization and utilization
of public finances; and (2) the Public Service Management Program (PSM) supporting
various dimensions of civil service reform.

            M&E quality was substantial, Bank performance was
            moderately satisfactory, Borrower performance was moderately
            satisfactory. Lessons for these projects include: (i) In
            low-capacity settings, where cities are barely able to meet
            service delivery needs, it may be necessary to deliver
            critical services while incrementally building municipal
            capacity for sustained service delivery over time. (ii)
            Interventions in land administration require a thorough
            analysis of the local, institutional, and political economy
            conditions. (iii) Excessive reliance on external expertise
            can undermine knowledge transfer and ultimately
            sustainability in municipal development projects. (iv)
            Achieving outcomes in solid waste management in low-capacity
            contexts requires a viable financial plan and mechanisms for
            capital and recurrent expenditures which may include
            contributions from national and local governments, private
            partnerships, and user fees. (v) Although achieving
            universal access to solid waste management is a significant
            achievement in low-capacity contexts, outcomes are
            undermined if investment in waste disposal is insufficient,
            especially for the most vulnerable. (vi) Land use
            transformation brought about by infrastructure investments
            can contribute positively to the local tax base, but it can
            also negatively affect poorer residents when land and

Some of the lessons learned included: 1) Whenever a multi-sector project singles out one particular sector for special attention, it needs to make the intended sectoral outcomes clear and monitorable, as well as ensuring that they are consistent with sector priorities; 2) As for any operation, M&E of a municipal development project should explore the use of existing databases (SINIM in this case) to help identify measurable baselines, indicators, and targets whose achievement can be monitored easily and cheaply; 3) The Bank should encourage borrowers and local agencies to develop and maintain customized databases on sub national development that are in short supply in many countries. When in the public domain they also contribute to increased transparency, accountability and, through these, to democracy; and 4) The Bank needs to develop a clearer and more precisely formulated framework for improving local governance-a framework that can readily be translated into operational objectives.",Country :  Chile,Content Type : Reports,"June 20, 2007

"Evaluation of World Bank Support for Public Sector Transparency and Accountability: Anticorruption, Justice, and External Audit Functions (Approach Paper)", PDF file,"Supporting client countries in building an open and accountable public sector that serves the needs of all citizens is core to economic development. Within any public sector, there are specific institutions or entities that are explicitly tasked with establishing, preserving, and improving the integrity of the public sector through the promotion of government system-wide transparency and accountability. The Bank has a long history of helping countries increase transparency and accountability and designing and implementing anticorruption programs. This evaluation will assess the relevance and effectiveness of Bank support to client country central government institutions/entities that have an explicit mandate to promote the integrity, transparency, and accountability of the broader public sector. The effectiveness of World Bank support will be assessed through the prism of (a) improved capacity of country-relevant institutions to perform their functions as a result of World Bank assistance, and (b) evidence of the actual contribution to these institutions to, and their role in, promoting public sector transparency and accountability.

Tunisia - Public Enterprise Reform Loan Project, Web Resource,"The Second Structural Adjustment
            Credit for Nepal was rated marginally satisfactory. The
            project achieved some of its objectives, its impact on
            institutional development was modest, sustainability is
            uncertain, and both the Bank and Borrower performed
            adequately. Several lessons can be learned from this
            project. First, IDA should have designed the project to pay
            greater attention to the country's institutional
            weakness and limited political support for measures that
            affect vested interests. Second, excessive reliance on
            foreign consultants resulted in the production of thick
            volumes and manuals that nobody used, but had negligible
            lasting impacts on local institutions. Third, efforts at
            improving coordination among donors were not successful
            because of the waste of resources, duplication of efforts,
            and territory disputes. Fourth, it was premature to include
            financial sector reforms in the absence of specific
            knowledge regarding the exact nature of the needed measures.
            Fifth, during the design of the credit, greater efforts
            should have been made to ensure the participation of the
            Borrower, including line ministries and agencies. Sixth,
            conditionality should have been better defined, calling for
            more specific measures rather than studies. Finally, one
            should weigh the importance/effectiveness of the measures
            selected for the reforms in any sector. ",Country :  Tunisia,Content Type : Reports,"June 30, 1995

Morocco - First and Second Transparency and Accountability Development Policy Loan, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses two International Bank for Reconstruction and Development loans (First and Second Transparency and
Accountability Development Policy Loans, known as Hakama 1 and 2) made to Morocco during 2013–16 and totaling approximately $407 million. The first operation was approved in October 2013 and the second in October 2015. The European Union and the African Development Bank provided parallel financing in the form of budget support; the European Union and World Bank also provided technical assistance.
The development objectives of the loans were to strengthen mechanisms promoting
transparency and accountability in the management of public resources, and to support legal reforms fostering open governance in Morocco in line with the new Constitution.

Ratings are as follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development was substantial, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lesson from these projects include: (i) Improved knowledge management and better use of knowledge enhance operational quality. (ii) Monitoring and evaluation require attention both at the design stage and during implementation. (iii) Greater transparency and better information management are needed to sustain dialogue as World Bank teams and counterparts change. (iv) It would be helpful to assess a cluster of mutually reinforcing World Bank operations jointly.

Tanzania - Public Service Reform Program Project, Web Resource,"Ratings for the Public Service Reform
            Program Project for Tanzania were as follows: outcomes were
            moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was
            high, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and
            Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some
            lessons learned included: an excessive focus on form rather
            than function in public service reform is counterproductive,
            particularly when based on models borrowed from other
            countries and implemented without sufficient consideration
            of local conditions. Using the number of new executive
            agencies as an indicator of success, as the project's
            result matrix did, is misleading. Insistence on considering
            capacity building outputs as outcomes shows a rather
            technocratic view of public service reform; as such changes
            are certainly visible to experts but invisible to citizens
            unless there is improved service delivery. Capacity building
            is incremental and must be translated into incremental
            improvements in performance with short term and medium term
            results. Performance incentives work only where management
            has enough autonomy in deciding how to combine resources to
            achieve results. Identification of risks and mitigating
            measures at project design, and sanctions during
            implementation, including suspension or cancellation of
            credits and grants, are important tools to be considered to
            address policy reversals. Projects should be shorter and
            smaller, aligning ambitions to capacity and political
            realities, building the next project on the achievements of
            the previous one, in fast cycles that require short
            preparation times, and a strong ability to listen and adjust
            quickly to the needs of reformers in government. ",Country :  Tanzania,Content Type : Reports,"September 9, 2013

Tanzania - Urban Sector Rehabilitation Project, Web Resource ,"The ratings for the Urban Sector Rehabilitation Project for Tanzania were as follows: outcome was satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was modest; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned from the projects included: projects dispersed over a wide geographical area. In this case, success came from: (i) logistics must be well worked out for the successful implementation of large packaging works into larger contracts to be undertaken by experienced large firms able to operate across these large areas; (ii) assembling design work already done under earlier operations; and (iii) fully deploying the Bank country office to ensure regular contact with client towns. Project experience demonstrates that direct technical assistance and training with on-the-job experience o f executing priority physical investments continues to be a winning combination for improving local government municipal management and urban service delivery. Project design should focus only upon intended outcomes that can feasibly be achieved and whose success can convincingly be demonstrated. Claims to attain higher level intended outcomes-economic development and poverty reduction in this case should only be made when there is a convincing rationale that project interventions can achieve them, and also a sound Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system to record the baseline, target and endline values of indicators to measure the achievement.",Country :  Tanzania,Content Type : Reports,"June 17, 2008

Bangladesh - Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development; and Power Sector Development Technical Assistance Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report evaluates the Bangladesh Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development (RERED) Project (fiscal years 2002 to 2013), the Power Sector Development Technical Assistance Project (fiscal years 2004 to 2013), and the Power Sector Development Policy Credit (fiscal years 2008 to 2009). Despite government's significant efforts, especially over the last decade, the country lags behind in providing electricity access to its population. The lack of access is particularly high in rural areas, even when compared with other countries in the South Asia Region. By examining the Bank's role and effectiveness over the past two decades of Bank support to Bangladesh's power sector over, the resulting findings and lessons will inform the forthcoming IEG ""Evaluation of the World Bank Group's Support for Electricity Access,"" as well as provide feedback for future engagement in this sector. Together, the projects addressed priority needs of the country's energy sector with the overall objective of raising levels of social development and economic growth in the country. The RERED project aimed to increase access to electricity in rural areas. It also worked to reduce atmospheric carbon emissions by overcoming market barriers for the use of renewable energy. Its overall outcome is rated Highly Satisfactory. The Technical Assistance (TA) Project sought to improve the government's capacity for formulating power sector policies, institutional structures, and a gas supply strategy needed for balanced development of Bangladesh's power sector. It also sought to prepare at least two power sector investment projects. The project's overall outcome is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The Development Policy Credit focused on enhanced governance and accountability, and on improved financial stability that would lead to better and more sustainable service provision, including improved private investment in generation. Its overall outcome is rated Unsatisfactory. The following lessons can be drawn, (i) Off-grid household electrification can accelerate the benefits of ""lighting"" in a cost-effective manner, to populations that face uncertain waiting periods for grid-based electricity, or are unlikely to obtain grid-based electricity due to remote or inaccessible locations. (ii) A public-private partnership model can efficiently deliver large-scale and dispersed off-grid electricity services, by deploying public funding through private sector stakeholders. (iii) One-off technical assistance or credit support operations should be highly strategic, selective and practical in supporting policy and institutional issues of a complex nature. (iv) One-off Credit operations cannot be expected to make headway on multiple policy fronts in a sector, especially if these issues have some commonalities with other sectors. The Power Sector Development Policy Credit single-tranche operation covered complex issues of governance and financial sustainability, which were difficult to resolve to any significant extent in a program of short duration. (v) Achieving broader social and economic outcomes from electricity access provision will primarily depend upon the pursuit of a least cost path for grid expansion backed by appropriate sector policies, complemented by off-grid electricity in the interim or permanently as needed.

Lessons from the project include: (i) Creating a decision-making environment with continuous results monitoring and course correction based on experience would be a more promising approach to complex reforms. (ii) The costs of building and upgrading a PFMIS when a country’s needs are evolving should be carefully assessed. (iii) An alternative design option for PFM modernization projects would involve a two-stage approach. (iv) Project implementation may be hindered by uneven institutional capacity.

Serbia - Private and Financial Sector Policy Based Guarantee Project, Web Resource ,"This PPAR is the first in a series of four currently under way to assess the early
performance of Policy-Based Guarantees (PBGs). The other three operations in the series
include two in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and one in Montenegro. All
four operations took place in Western Balkan countries during 2011-14. Following
completion of the four PPARs, an Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) learning product
is envisaged to synthesize high-level lessons from the early use of the PBG instrument,
with a view to its potentially wider applicability to Bank member countries.
This report evaluates the Private and Financial Sector Policy-Based Guarantee (PFPBG)
to Serbia, which was approved on February 10, 2011. The operational phase of the policy
reforms supported by the operation ended on the effectiveness date of April 15, 2011; this

            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance
            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:
            a common donor approach to project design and implementation
            can yield positive results by utilizing and strengthening
            the same implementing agency, using a consistent results
            framework, aligning fiduciary and safeguards requirements,
            using similar criteria in selecting and implementing
            projects, and conducting joint supervision missions. The
            programmatic approach used in the Municipal Development
            Program allows for the evolution of effective reform
            solutions through identifying needs in road management,
            designing and implementing capacity building efforts, and
            learning from experience. The inability to combine resources
            of the many financing partners can adversely affect the size
            of projects and the composition of the sub-projects. Use of
            local codes, materials, and experiences in building roads
            instead of internationally accepted technical standards
            lowers costs, but can also compromise quality. ",Country :  West Bank and Gaza,Content Type : Reports,"June 16, 2015

Philippines - Water Districts Development Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) evaluates the Philippines Water Districts Development Project (WDDP) implemented by the World Bank from fiscal 1997 to 2006. The project was designed to address the problem of declining water supply and sanitation (WSS) service levels in the Philippines, which were a result of rapid population growth and urbanization that occurred in the early 1990s. Both the World Bank and the government of the Philippines recognized the serious constraints in the WSS sector, including the lack of a sector policy and transparent financing criteria, inadequate incentives for commercial operations, a highly fragmented market, low tariffs, and political interference in tariff-setting. The objectives of the WDDP were to create a policy framework encouraging the participation of the private sector in water utilities, and to support the participating local government units (LGUs) in improving water, sewerage, sanitation, and drainage within the areas of their jurisdiction. IEG rated the overall project outcome as moderately satisfactory. Key issues that hindered the successful implementation of the project were high drop-out rates of LGUs, conversion from a project to a program approach during restructuring, political changes and risks, and delays resulting from the participatory processes for subprojects. IEG outlines the following lessons learned as a result of the implementation of WDDP: a) a sudden change in a projectâs lending approach works against effective project implementation; b) issues stemming from the local political economy need to be addressed at project entry; c) participatory processes (usually associated with social and environmental safeguards) require substantial up-front time, which needs to be built into the project planning; and d) complex subprojects require borrower expertise beyond procurement and financial management.

            Highway Sector project whose sustainability is rated as
            likely and institutional development as substantial. These

            mainly for the rating of sustainability. The ICRs rate
            sustainability as likely for all but the railway project,
            which was rated as uncertain. The audit also downgrades the
            institutional development rating of the Railway Technical

            with the Government of Indonesia in the transport sector
            shifts to a focus on institutional and policy development
            and on reducing rent-seeking. In particular, the Bank should

"World Bank Group Support for the Reform of State-Owned Enterprises, 2007-2018: An IEG Evaluation (Approach Paper)", PDF file,"State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) play a critical role in many developing and
emerging economies. Governments use SOEs to pursue economic, social and political
objectives. These can include such objectives as promoting growth in promising sectors or
lagging regions, delivering services to the urban or rural poor or general population,
addressing market failures such as natural monopoly, filling perceived market gaps,
financing investments whose size or risk make private investment unlikely, or addressing
issues of heightened national priority or security.

The evaluation will review the experience of the WBG supporting SOE reforms
over the ten-year period 2008-2018. It will: (i) assess the ways in which WBG support to
SOE reform achieved its stated objectives (including the extent to which those objectives
were aligned with the strategies of the Bank Group, country, and relevant sectors); (ii)
identify what worked (success factors and examples of good practice); and (iii) draw lessons

            risk to development outcome was negligible to low, the Bank
            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower
            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons
            learned included: consistency and stability of personnel are
            important. In this case, turnover of both
            consultants/advisors and task team leaders negatively
            impacted project performance at various stages of
            implementation. A modest initial project scope, producing
            quick and demonstrable wins, can be preferable to early
            ambition. In this case, the complexity of planned activities
            and results matrix overwhelmed staff with limited capacity,
            necessitating restructuring to streamline. Deliberate and
            focused attention to balancing the implementation and
            capacity building roles of external technical advisors is
            critical for long-term success. In this case, the advisors
            frequently assumed direct implementation roles in response

            Assistance (Pancheswar) Projects for Nepal. The Marsyangdi
            Hydroelectric Power Project was rated satisfactory. Its
            sustainability is likely, its impact on institutional
            development was modest, and the performance of both the Bank
            and Borrower was unsatisfactory. The Third Technical
            Assistance (Pancheswar) Project was rated unsatisfactory.
            Its sustainability is uncertain, its impact on institutional
            development was modest, and the performance of both the Bank
            and Borrower was unsatisfactory. Several lessons can be
            learned from these projects. First, when considering
            hydropower as part of its assistance program, IDA must
            always apply its most stringent guidelines and be very
            mindful of its mixed record. Second, the performance of the
            power sector in less developed countries is most vulnerable
            to weak public sector management. It is imperative that IDA
            fully applies its 1992 policies. Finally, future involvement
            in the power sector of Nepal should be conditioned on
            substantial private sector involvement in NEA's
            operations with an adequate timeframe and a set of
            incentives to improve quality of service, losses, finances,

Lessons learned from the projects included: parallel funded operations in which all donors do not share a key objective (privatization in this case) should generally be avoided and preference given to a single donor approach. If operations with divergent aims cannot be avoided, then the project design should ensure each donor has control over the components that are instrumental to the achievement of its own particular objectives. Careful assessments of users' willingness and ability to pay, borrower agencies' institutional and financial performance, the financial impact of a project upon users and providers should always be part of the appraisal of projects that incur significant operating costs over the medium to long term. Cost recovery and project financial performance should be monitored thoroughly during supervision. The World Bank (WB) should bring problems-such as financial shortfalls that imperil project achievements immediately to the attention of a borrower, continually offering high quality hands-on technical advice on solutions as needed. If current revenues are insufficient and repeated requests for strengthening them ignored, then the WB should seek remedies under the legal agreements that might include the suspension of disbursements and/ or cancellation of a project.",Country :  Uzbekistan,Content Type : Reports,"June 9, 2008

Mongolia - Governance Assistance Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) evaluates the Governance Assistance Project (GAP) of the International Development Association (IDA) in Mongolia (P170780). The project was approved in March 2006 in the amount of special drawing rights 9.7 million (equivalent to US$14 million), funded by an IDA grant. Following two extensions, it closed on December 31, 2014. This assessment aims to review whether and how the operation achieved its intended objectives. The PPAR also examines the long-term sustainability of GAP support, such as the extent to which the GAP’s main achievements have been sustained more than four years since the project’s closure. This report provides additional evidence and analysis of relevant data for a more complete picture of the project outcomes and the factors that influenced them. By reviewing developments from 2014 to 2019 (after the project closed), it offers an opportunity for a longer-term perspective on the factors affecting outcomes.

Ratings for this project are as follows: Outcome as satisfactory, risk to development outcome was modest, bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. This PPAR offers the following lessons: (i) In a low-capacity environment, introduction of basic technical solutions and application of incremental step-by-step reforms can be an effective strategy. (ii) Implementation risks related to project complexity and multiple government implementing agencies can be successfully managed if there is strong leadership from the core government agency (such as the Ministry of Finance) and an experienced and empowered Project Coordination Unit. (iii) Technical assistance projects with multisectoral coverage require significant supervision support. Lack of budget can limit the ability of the World Bank to provide the specialized technical inputs needed to help the client make better design and implementation choices.

Kazakhstan - Urban Transport Project, Web Resource,"The Urban Transport Project was rated
            as marginally satisfactory because of the less than optimal
            outcome of the bus component, which constituted 75 percent
            of the loan. This audit report questions the relevance of
            the bus component to support state-owned bus operators when
            reforms were going in parallel to increase the private
            sector participation in the transport sector. Moreover, the
            efficiency and net benefit of the project was reduced
            because of the long and complex process to procure the
            buses. Finally, the bus component was less efficacious than
            expected because when the buses did finally arrive, the
            private sector had already been unleashed and begun
            dominating service provision throughout the project cities.
            The key lessons learned include: 1) Policy and institutional
            reforms that are capable of unleashing private
            entrepreneurship and competition in the urban public
            transport sector are sufficient to improve the quality and
            quantity of the urban public transport system. 2) A
            conducive institutional framework capable of defining and
            enforcing property rights and contractual agreements is
            essential for private sector to make the necessary
            investment to maintain and improve the quality of services.
            3) In a deficient institutional environment, providing
            exclusive franchise rights to operators is not sustainable.
            4) It is important to take note of the country's
            circumstances and institutional realities when designing and
            evaluating a procurement bid. ",Country :  Kazakhstan,Content Type : Reports,"June 29, 2000

Indonesia - Second and Third Urban Poverty Project, Web Resource ,"This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for two Indonesian projects:
1. The Second Urban Poverty Project (credit 3658 and loans 4664 and 7752): A
World Bank IBRD loan 4664 in the amount of US$29.5 million and an IDA credit
of US$70.5 million, were approved on June 13, 2002. In April 2007 additional
finance was also approved comprising a credit of US$135.5 million to
accommodate a large geographic extension of the project to new areas. On July
22, 2009 the loan was converted into loan 7752 because of a change in the loan
terms from variable to fixed interest rates. The project closed on December 31,
2010, two and a half years later than planned, and US$3.2 million was cancelled.
2. The Third Urban Poverty Project (credit 4063 and loans 4779 and 7759): A
World Bank IBRD loan of US$67.3 million and an IDA credit of US$71.4
million, were approved in May 2005. In July 2009 the loan was converted into
loan 7759 because of a change in the loan terms from variable to fixed interest
rates. The loan closed as planned on March 31, 2011, with US$66.6 million
disbursed, and US$0.6 million was cancelled. For the credit, which also closed on
March 31, 2011, US$71.4 million was disbursed, and an amount of US$0.02
million cancelled. The cancellations were primarily due to the exchange rate
fluctuation between the US dollar and the Indonesian Rupiah.

Argentina - First Municipal Development Project, Web Resource,"The audit downgrades the assessment
            of outcome to marginally satisfactory, though concurs with
            the uncertain sustainability, and substantial institutional
            development impact ratings of the Implementation Completion
            Report. Lessons address primarily, institutional
            strengthening, not as a causal relationship for municipal
            administrative changes, but as a practice involving tough
            decisions, and real costs, which needs particular attention.
            It is suggested to actively promote the success of two
            unique municipalities, sharing its experience particularly
            in system design. Secondly, the need for improved monitoring
            indicators is analyzed, for adequate indicators would have
            helped identify, for example, cost recovery issues, which
            required further project supervision. The absence of
            covenant enforcement to cover cost recovery, required
            impractical efforts, further hampered by political
            opposition, but, improved financial management capacity,
            should gradually improve costs collection. Incidentally, the
            financial crisis, and subsequent reductions in provincial
            financial transfers to municipalities, motivated mayors to
            improve administration, and subproject cost recovery.
            Finally, the analytic alternatives to proposed subprojects
            is questioned, arguing whether a demand-driven approach is
            really the right one. ",Country :  Argentina,Content Type : Reports,"June 16, 2000

Ghana - Second Education Sector Adjustment Credit Project, Web Resource,"The overall outcome of the project is
            rated as marginally unsatisfactory; sustainability as
            uncertain; institutional development as modest; borrower
            performance as unsatisfactory; and Bank performance as
            unsatisfactory. The project experience suggests some
            cautionary lessons for the Bank: 1) As the Bank and other
            donors shift from supporting education projects to financing
            borrower-driven sectoral program involving long-term
            commitment and heavy investments, they need to ensure that
            the programs are technically sound, readily implementable
            given existing institutional capacities and stakeholder
            interests, and financially sustainable. 2) In designing
            adaptable lending instruments, the Bank needs to support
            flexibility and also ensure that the flexibility does not
            undermine budgetary discipline and cost-efficiency. 3) In
            simplifying disbursement procedures, sharing
            responsibilities for project quality under matrix management
            and decentralizing more responsibilities to the field, the
            Bank needs to ensure that project activities and
            expenditures remain consistent with development objectives
            as expressed in legal agreements. 4) In its dialogue with
            the borrower, the Bank should emphasize the importance of
            implementing operational plans to ensure development impact
            and sustainability. But, it should not raise expectations of
            finance for follow-on projects prematurely before the
            borrower's plans for the future have fully absorbed the
            lessons of experience. ",Country :  Ghana,Content Type : Reports,"December 11, 1998

India - First and Second Tamil Nadu Urban Development Projects, Web Resource ,"The Tamil Nadu Urban Development Project (TNUDF) had the following ratings: outcome was moderately satisfactory; institutional development impact was modest; risk to development outcome was significant; Bank performance was satisfactory; and borrower performance was satisfactory. The Second Tamil Nadu Urban Development Project had the following ratings: outcome was satisfactory; institutional development impact was high; risk to development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory; and borrower performance was satisfactory. Experience with these projects highlights the following lessons: 1) The TNUDF model is a viable and effective model capable of being replicated elsewhere in India but as the model will have limited success in the absence of Urban Local Body (ULB) capacity, it should be replicated with the design features which were most successful in improving ULB capacity, namely the grant fund for project preparation, and encouraging the development of close working relations between ULBs and Fund, especially as a source of easily accessible technical expertise; 2) Priority infrastructural needs of the urban poor are often not the same as that of the urban population as a whole; 3) Efforts should be made to find the right balance between the financial intermediary approach and the direct provision of infrastructure approach in urban infrastructure provision, on the one hand by targeting grant funding mainly to meet the needs of the poor and on the other by encouraging financial discipline and a debt culture among ULBs; 4) Cost recovery of infrastructure investments from the poor should be well thought out, implemented in a transparent manner and include a dispute resolution mechanism that the poor can access; 5) The Bank is able to have a less costly but still relevant role in financing small city infrastructure needs when it is able to hand over subproject supervision to an intermediary such as the TNUDF. In such instances the Bank's role is redefined as a provider of policy advice through intellectual support and technical knowledge, a role which it performed well in TNUDP-11; and 6) Projects need to develop meaningful M&E frameworks at design, which focus on the development impact, and with a definite baseline and targets to measure performance as well as guide project implementation.",Country :  India,Content Type : Reports,"June 19, 2007

Chile - Primary Education Improvement Project, Web Resource,"The project attained most of its
            targets and in many instances exceeded them. Though it did
            not profoundly change the operation of the Ministry of
            Education, it helped significantly to develop institutional,
            managerial, and financial capacity. It produced a
            significant impact on the quality of education at the
            classroom level of municipal and rural schools, as reflected
            in achievement test results. The school-based quality
            improvement program gave grants to schools interested in
            stimulating the energy and creativity of teachers. A special
            education component improved the quality of education for
            children with various special needs. Pre-school education
            was expanded to cover 29 percent of the eligible population.
            The audit agrees with the ICR that Borrower performance was
            highly satisfactory but adjudges Bank performance as
            satisfactory. Lessons pertinent to Bank operations from this
            audit are: The same procurement rules must apply equally to
            all Bank Borrowers. Latin American and South Asia should not
            use interpretations that differ to such an extent that some
            countries are forced to spend years preparing for
            international competitive bidding and others exempted.
            Burdensome procurement rules exhaust the time and resources
            that countries may devote to implementation and detract from
            project substance. Bank appraisals and supervisions should
            emphasize classroom-level instructional delivery issues at
            least as much as they emphasize organizational and economic issues. ",Country :  Chile,Content Type : Reports,"March 21, 2001

Trinidad and Tobago - Structural Adjustment Loan, Web Resource,"The Baluchistan Minor Irrigation and
            Agricultural Development Project for Pakistan was
            satisfactory. The project achieved most its objectives, its
            impact has been substantial, sustainability is likely,
            institutional development was partially successful, and both
            the Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several
            lessons can be learned from this project. First, there is a
            need to provide adequate after-care for irrigation
            investments. Donors need to allocate resources for
            post-completion activities. Second, the Bank's current
            project cycle was not well suited to this particular
            project. It would have been more appropriate to implement
            the project as a pilot instead of a full project in order to
            develop the institutions, collect information, and learn
            from the experience of working with the beneficiaries. This
            would allow the Borrower to learn how to implement the
            project effectively. Third, participatory processes should
            not be used to market Bank or government goals but to elicit
            community goal setting and leadership. Lastly, the project
            was enormously costly in Bank staff time. The Bank
            contributed no special expertise that another donor could
            not have provided and other donors were available. Any
            resource transfer objective could have been achieved more
            easily in other ways. ",Country :  Trinidad and Tobago,Content Type : Reports,"June 27, 1995

Cambodia : demand for good governance project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses the Demand for Good Governance (DFGG) Project, which was approved by the Board on December 2, 2008, became effective on June 24, 2009, and closed on September 30, 2014, for a total project cost of $21.42 million. The project development objective (PDO) was to enhance DFGG in priority reform areas by strengthening institutions, supporting partnerships, and sharing lessons. Enhancing the DFGG Project was further unpacked in the project results framework into four specific objectives: (i) promote, (ii) mediate, (iii) respond to, or (iv) monitor to inform DFGG. 

Ratings for Demand for Good Governance Project were as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. The review finds three key lessons: (i) Timely identification of key changes in policy during project implementation can substantially impact project results. (ii) The additional resources and time needed for the direct support to non-state actors to be effective should not be underestimated. (iii) Projects aiming at strengthening accountability should pay more attention to the political economy.

            excellent job of pre-selecting conservation investment
            sub-components and adjusting its internal policies to fit
            the Bank's procurement requirements. The lessons
            learned include: (i) with the high risks of making incorrect
            investment decisions in a country with a highly distorted
            financial and capital markets, subprojects need to
            demonstrate a high economic return, a short payback period,
            and significant positive externalities to justify targeted
            lending, since such lending is clearly a second best
            alternative to restructuring financial and exchange control
            mechanisms. Individual energy conservation investments of
            the type implemented in Hungary appear justified on that
            basis; and (ii) monitoring, evaluation and dissemination
            feedback of the results of energy conservation subprojects
            should be considered as an essential function of an apex on
            lending organization. ",Country :  Philippines,Content Type : Reports,"June 12, 1997

Mali - Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment Project (PESAP), Web Resource,"The Energy Sector Adjustment Loan for
            Cote d'Ivoire was marginally satisfactory. The project
            achieved some of its objectives, its impact on institutional
            development was modest, sustainability is uncertain, and the
            performance of both the Bank and Borrower was mixed. Several
            lessons can be learned from this project. First, SECALs are
            inappropriate for complex and slow institutional, financial,
            and managerial reform programs. Second, it is important for
            executing agencies to have ""ownership"" of the
            reform program. Third, private management contracts for
            public utilities are no panacea and can give rise to new
            problems and costs. Fourth, it is more advisable to opt for
            full privatization involving asset sales or a full-blown
            ""concession"" contract when the private operator is
            also responsible for all new investment in the sector.
            Finally, a fully transparent and competitive privatization
            process appears to be incompatible with the rapidity of
            decisions and political realities in many countries, where
            public acceptance of privatization has yet to gain
            widespread support. ",Country :  Mali,Content Type : Reports,"June 29, 1994

Albania - Durres Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation and Water Supply Urgent Rehabilitation Projects, Web Resource ,"Regarding the Durres Water and
            Sanitation Rehabilitation (DWSR) Project, the audit ratings
            differ from the Implementation Completion Report's, in
            that the assessment upgrades sustainability to likely, yet
            downgrades the institutional development impact rating to
            negligible, but concurs with unsatisfactory project outcome,
            and performances both by the Bank and Borrower. In relation
            to the Water Supply Urgent Rehabilitation (WSUR) Project,
            the audit fully concurs with satisfactory project outcomes,
            likely sustainability, modest institutional development
            impacts, and satisfactory performances. Three main lessons
            address the following: 1) The importance for project
            flexibility during implementation increases, particularly
            under difficult situations. The primary focus of these two
            projects on physical rehabilitation was appropriate, given
            the government's concern with political reform and
            civil unrest. It also provided time to nurture on
            institutional reform agenda and build borrower buy-ins. This
            subsequently made it possible to help the government cope
            with ongoing urgent issues resulting from the 1999 crisis
            caused by the influx of refugees from Kosovo. 2) Sequencing
            of demanding reform activities and major rehabilitation
            efforts, as well as the timeframe for their implementation,
            need to be adequately analyzed to take full account of
            practical priorities, and the available implementation
            capacity. 3) The early establishment of a benchmark system
            is important to facilitate appropriate monitoring of
            progress and evaluation of impact of activities. ",Country :  Albania,Content Type : Reports,"February 14, 2005

Ghana - Second Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FINSAC II), Web Resource,"The National Seed and Quarantine
            Project for Nigeria will increase agricultural production
            and farm incomes. The project objective is to assist in the
            cost effective and timely production of good quality seed,
            implicitly including the prevention of the introduction of
            exotic diseases of plants. The outcome of the project was
            satisfactory, including the Bank's and borrower's
            performance. Production of foundation and certified seed was
            successfully transferred to private seed companies and
            outgrowers. Other achievements were mixed: (a) several
            committees were formed, but meetings were irregular, (b) the
            SAR recommended structure of the NSS was implemented only in
            1992, after which it was further reformed (the
            implementation completion report takes no position as to
            whether this was a further improvement), (c) as agreed
            ADP's (Bank sponsored Agricultural Development
            Projects) withdrew from certified seed production in order
            to promote praavte sector seed development, and (d) a
            Revolving Fund was established for the Seed Production
            Program, but was eroded as it was used to substitute for
            counterpart funding. Lessons cited by the implementation
            completion report are, (a) need for training to facilitate
            project take-off, (b) early appointment of needed
            consultants, (c) proper planning of procurement (and customs
            clearance), (d) successor projects are needed to assure
            sustained impact. None of these lessons are new. The WBG

Senegal - Electricity Sector Efficiency Enhancement Project and Energy Sector Recovery Development Policy Credit Project, Web Resource,"Ratings for the Electricity Sector
            Efficiency Enhancement Project; and Energy Sector Recovery
            Development Policy Credit Project for Senegal was as
            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development
            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was
            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also
            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: proper
            sequencing of sector policy dialogue and investment support
            is important for success when the two are closely connected.
            The Bank has an important role in ensuring that investment
            decisions are made based on technical, financial, and
            economic merits. Where a country's political timetable
            is liable to bring significant shifts in policy, a keen
            appreciation of political economy is necessary. The Bank has
            much to gain from locating key operational staff in the
            field, particularly where a continuous and intense dialogue
            is required, such as Senegal's energy sector.
            Inattention to the good practice principles for the
            application of conditionality can result in policy-based
            operations that are unbalanced and lack focus. In designing
            policy-based operations, a realistic sense of the pace of
            reform will take account of political economy considerations. ",Country :  Senegal,Content Type : Reports,"September 26, 2013

Madagascar - Antananarivo Plain Development Project, Web Resource,"The audit largely concurs with the
            Implementation Completion Reports' (ICR) ratings of
            unlikely sustainability, negligible institutional
            development, and unsatisfactory Bank performance. However,
            the outcome of the project is assessed as moderately
            unsatisfactory, and, the performance of the Borrower as
            unsatisfactory, in contrast with the ICR's satisfactory
            assessments. The project experience seems to reinforce the
            lesson that projects are not sustainable without
            institutions, and supportive policies. Civil works financed
            under the project, will likely fall into disuse, and
            generate no benefits, given the absence of an institution to
            plan, operate, rehabilitate, and extend the flood control,
            rainwater drainage, sanitary sewerage, and solid waste
            management systems. Moreover, it is unrealistic to expect
            far-reaching reforms to take root, in the limited project
            implementation period of externally funded projects: the two
            key institutions - the Flood Protection Authority (APIPA),
            and the Antananarivo Autonomous Maintenance Service (SAMVA),
            were created after loan approval, and only four years prior
            to loan closing, inducing resistance by local political
            interests, due to perceived impositions. Given this
            environment, it is unlikely that either institution will
            prosper in the absence of a follow-up support - from within
            the country, as well as from external financing, and
            technical assistance. Finally, it is recommended that
            project design carefully match project ambitions and design,
            to the administrative, and financial capacity of the
            country, suggesting an Adaptable Program Lending will likely
            reduce risks, by carefully gauging the political support for
            each project component. ",Country :  Madagascar,Content Type : Reports,"June 20, 2001

            opens the way for privatization of services, but other
            preconditions must be met before the private sector

Venezuela - Financial Sector Adjustment Loan Project, Web Resource,"The Mardan Salinity Control and

            rural infrastructure projects being implemented in Pakistan
            at that time. The International Development Association
            (IDA) proceeded in the face of clear signals from the
            Borrower that it would not commit the stipulated resources
            to the project. The result was major delays in approval, a
            major scaling down, and delays by the Borrower in finding
            funds thereafter. The project suffered major implementation
            delays as did other rural infrastructure projects being
            implemented in Pakistan at that time. There were major
            problems with contractors and project works were completed

            would be equitable if beneficiaries paid for this cleaning,
            as well as for the maintenance of canals and headworks which
            they cannot handle by themselves. Perhaps Mardan's
            irrigator associations, presently moribund for want of a
            useful role, could find one in repair of watercourses and
            subsidiary canals. Though it may be a long-term proposition,
            giving irrigators incentives to organize themselves and to

            Several lessons can be learned from these projects. First,

            of the Economic Restructuring Credit (ERC) and Public
            Manufacturing Enterprises Adjustment Credit (PMEAC) Projects
            for Sri Lanka. The ERC Project was rated marginally
            satisfactory. It partially achieved its objectives, its
            impact on institutional development was negligible,
            sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of both the

            impact on institutional development was modest,
            sustainability is likely, and the performance of both the

            learned from these projects. First, for Sri Lanka to
            continue to experience growth with equity, it must once
            again address the stabilization problems that it has twice
            failed to resolve. Second, civil service reform should be
            seen as a comprehensive package rather than as a mechanical
            exercise driven by the number of separations. Third, the
            failure to complete the restructuring of the state
            commercial banks can be expected to remain a significant
            impediment to the functioning of a more effective,
            liberalized economy. Fourth, the adjustment program
            disbursed too much money over too short a time period.
            Fifth, while policy-oriented lending can be very productive,
            the timing and targets of this support are crucial. Finally,
            it is important to improve the perceived fairness of the

Vietnam - Third Phase of Higher Education Development Policy Program, Web Resource,"Ratings for the Planning and

            Timor-Leste were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the
            risk to development outcome was negligible to low, the Bank
            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower
            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons
            learned included: consistency and stability of personnel are
            important. In this case, turnover of both
            consultants/advisors and task team leaders negatively
            impacted project performance at various stages of
            implementation. A modest initial project scope, producing
            quick and demonstrable wins, can be preferable to early
            ambition. In this case, the complexity of planned activities
            and results matrix overwhelmed staff with limited capacity,
            necessitating restructuring to streamline. Deliberate and
            focused attention to balancing the implementation and
            capacity building roles of external technical advisors is
            critical for long-term success. In this case, the advisors

"Mozambique: ProMaputo, Maputo Municipal Development Program (MMDP I and II) (PPAR)", Web Resource ,"The Maputo Municipal Development Program (MMDP) was designed to directly respond to the need for institutional strengthening to achieve sustained service delivery. Given the need for sustained support, the project was conceived as multiphase programmatic approach of adaptable program loans (APLs) with sequenced objectives. The project development objective of phase I was “to strengthen the Maputo City Council’s institutional and financial capacity to support achievement of long-term service delivery goals, and to implement selected priority investments” (World Bank 2007). Phase II continued to strengthen capacities and to scale up municipal service delivery and infrastructure investments. The project development objective of APL II was “to improve the delivery and sustainability of priority municipal services in Maputo Municipality” (World Bank 2010). 

Ratings for the ProMaputo, Maputo Municipal Development Program I were as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was substantial, M&E quality was substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory, Borrower performance was satisfactory. Ratings for the Maputo Municipal Development Program II (MMDP II) were as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was substantial, M&E quality was substantial, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons for these projects include: (i) In low-capacity settings, where cities are barely able to meet service delivery needs, it may be necessary to deliver critical services while incrementally building municipal capacity for sustained service delivery over time. (ii) Interventions in land administration require a thorough analysis of the local, institutional, and political economy conditions. (iii) Excessive reliance on external expertise can undermine knowledge transfer and ultimately sustainability in municipal development projects. (iv) Achieving outcomes in solid waste management in low-capacity contexts requires a viable financial plan and mechanisms for capital and recurrent expenditures which may include contributions from national and local governments, private partnerships, and user fees. (v) Although achieving universal access to solid waste management is a significant achievement in low-capacity contexts, outcomes are undermined if investment in waste disposal is insufficient, especially for the most vulnerable. (vi) Land use transformation brought about by infrastructure investments can contribute positively to the local tax base, but it can also negatively affect poorer residents when land and housing prices rise.

Maximizing the Impact of Development Policy Financing in IDA Countries: A Stocktaking of Success Factors and Risks - An IEG Meso Evaluation, PDF file,"Development policy financing (DPF) has evolved from supporting structural adjustment programs in the 1980s and 1990s to supporting the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the 2000s. It has been considered by multilateral and bilateral donors as one of the instruments that would best enable the realization of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. However, the use of budget support as a preferred aid modality has been diminishing, especially among European member states. 

This evaluation is expected to inform decisions on the use of Development Policy Financing (DPF) in IDA countries by providing evaluative insights into drivers of success and risks. This is pertinent in the context of the record replenishment for IDA18 in the face of a declining share of DPF in IDA commitments during the last three IDA cycles. In this context, it is worthwhile to examine the factors that have driven DPF success in the past so as to inform decisions on the role of this development financing instrument in IDA countries going forward.", ,Content Type : Reports,"May 23, 2018

Country Program Evaluation - Papua New Guinea: An Evaluation of World Bank Support FY08–22 (Approach Paper), PDF file,"This Country Program Evaluation (CPE) will assess the World Bank Group’s engagement in Papua New Guinea between FY08 and FY22. The Papua New Guinea has an abundant resource endowment of oil and mineral
wealth, but this wealth has not translated into significant welfare gains for most citizens. Papua New Guinea’s fragmented geography and frequent exposure to disasters caused by natural hazards present significant challenges for delivering services to citizens. The evaluation is designed to derive lessons from Bank Group engagement in Papua New Guinea to inform the next Country Partnership Framework (CPF). The CPE will also provide lessons on the implementation of the International Development Association special themes of climate change, gender, and fragility, conflict, and violence and of the cross-cutting issues of debt sustainability and governance and institutions. Lessons may also be of relevance to other resource-rich countries.

The evaluation will assess the relevance and effectiveness of Bank Group support to enabling private sector participation in climate action, including the drivers that led to positive results. It aims to identify lessons applicable to the World Bank, IFC, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) by obtaining evidence-based findings on what works, why, and for whom. Such lessons can inform the implementation of the Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) 2021 and subsequent Bank Group activities. The focus on the enabling environment has been chosen because researchers, policy makers, and climate action practitioners realized that creating an enabling environment is a key priority for the private sector to engage in climate action. The need to enhance the enabling environment for private sector participation in climate action is critical to meet the trillions in investments needed to address climate change and achieve Paris Agreement goals.", ,Content Type : Reports,"October 4, 2022

India - Mumbai Urban Transport Project, Web Resource ,"This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the World Bank-supported
Mumbai Urban Transport Project in India. At appraisal, the total project cost was
estimated at US$945 million, while the final cost was US$1,128 million. An International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) oan of US$463 million (Ln. 4665)
and an International Development Association (IDA) credit of US$79 million (Cr. 3662)
were approved on June 18, 2002. The closing date was originally June 30, 2008, but the
project actually closed on June 15, 2011, nearly three years later.
The Mumbai Metropolitan Region is one of the world's largest urban areas with a
population of 20.7 million. Mumbai is the major commercial, entertainment, and fashion
center in India and one of the world's top 10 centers of commerce in terms of global
financial flows. Suburban rail services are the backbone of the region's transportation
system, but at project appraisal they were carrying more passengers than capacity,
resulting in extremely overloaded trains. Rail service demand in Mumbai went up from
6.1 million to 7.2 million passengers per day between the project start and closure. For
this project, the World Bank supported a comprehensive urban transport plan, which was
in line with the Bank's strategy to help overcome infrastructure bottlenecks, thus
promoting economic growth and reducing poverty. Capacity building for all relevant
entities was included.

            sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of both the

            period of economic crisis. Second, local management of rural
            water operation and maintenance can result in more reliable
            service and substantial economy. Third, the level of
            competence of sector management can make a significant
            difference in performance. Fourth, without an up-front
            understanding on the duration of an assignment, once an
            entity has been given overriding powers over other entities,
            is it very difficult to restore the former lines of
            responsibilities. Finally, it is important to not lose sight

Mexico - The Second Tropical Agricultural Development Project and the Decentralization and Regional Development Project, Web Resource,"The Land Reform Areas Project (Loan
            2198-TH) and the Second Land Titling Project (Loan 3254-TH)
            in Thailand took different approaches to land
            administration. The Land Reform Areas Project received
            unsatisfactory ratings in the area of development outcome,
            in light of its limited relevance to the objectives of
            sustainable land management and poverty reduction, as well
            as its poor economic rate of return. Institutional
            development impact is rated negligible because management
            and planning capacity of the implementing agency was not
            enhanced by the project. The audit rates borrower and Bank
            performance as unsatisfactory, primarily because both
            parties performed poorly during the identification and
            preparation phase, creating a project that responded weakly
            to the development needs of Thailand. The Second Land
            Titling Project received an outcome rate of satisfactory
            rather than highly satisfactory because the project failed
            to meet its original titling target. Furthermore it did not
            grapple with broader land administration issues, notably the
            unclear boundaries between private and public land. OED
            finds Bank performance and borrower performance to have been
            satisfactory rather than highly satisfactory, because
            institutional weaknesses could have been more fully
            addressed, coordination with other land administration
            agencies could have been stronger, and more provision could
            have been made for evaluating the impact of land titling on
            poverty reduction and natural resource management. The
            following lessons were gleaned from the projects: land
            titling and land reform efforts need to be grounded in an
            overall rural development strategy that weighs the relative
            cost and likely impact of various alternatives for reducing
            rural poverty and improving natural resource management; the
            success of systematic adjudication in Thailand owes much to
            circumstances that may not apply elsewhere; there is a need
            to provide farmers in the Land Reform Areas with efficient
            land surveying services leading to full (NS4) title, define
            and mark forest boundaries to enable the titling of
            contiguous lands, and share land information data more
            effectively between government agencies; and the case for

The objectives were highly relevant to country conditions both at the time of entry and closing, and well aligned to government and World Bank Group strategies.

Ratings for Business Productivity and Efficiency Development Policy Loans I-III were as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons include (i) The experience of this DPL program suggests that in-depth knowledge and government buy-in are essential in Colombia for designing reform programs with substance. (ii) Staggering interventions by policy areas presented trade-offs between the breadth and depth of the program.

Colombia - Peace and Development Project, Web Resource ,"Colombia has experienced internal armed conflict for the last 50 years. The conflict has been waged primarily in rural areas and over control of territory, particularly in regions characterized by weak institutions and, in many cases, corruption and cronyism, impunity, expansion of illicit crop cultivation, and weak civil society links to state institutions owing to lack of opportunities for participation (World Bank 2013:1). Over time, the conflict has spawned a complex array of non-state actors who have waged terror as a weapon of war. Specifically, their modus operandi has included systematic large-scale human rights violations, such as public executions, disappearances, massacres, town take-overs, extortions, assassinations, kidnappings, and forced recruitment of children. Against this backdrop of conflict and violence, the World Bank provided support through the Peace and Development Project (PDP) to assist vulnerable, low-income and displaced populations in rural and urban communities in the conflict-affected regions to reduce the risk of their exposure to conflict and mitigate the negative impact of possible derived effects.

Ratings for Colombia Peace and Development Project are as follows: Outcome is moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome is significant, Bank performance is satisfactory, and Borrower performance is moderately satisfactory. The findings from the performance assessment of the PDP suggest the following lessons: (i) Identifying and supporting activities that create lasting shared interest among community members is a critical building block for generating a community response to conflict. (ii) Having separate but similar activities for IDPs and host communities is not advisable in a CDD project since such separation deters social cohesion via competition for resources. (iii) The support of a respected and neutral third party organization can be key for the successful implementation of a CDD project in a conflict-affected area. (iv) Projects that seek to deter displacement may not necessarily reduce exposure to conflict since displacement can sometimes be the only option for citizens whose lives or livelihoods are severely threatened. (v) Socioeconomic stabilization and a strengthened social fabric can deter preventive displacement but both are insufficient to deter reactive displacement which is driven by direct threats.

Tunisia - Municipal Sector Investment Project, Web Resource,"The audit rates the outcome of the
            project as satisfactory, sustainability as likely, and the
            institutional development impact as substantial,
            highlighting sector issues relevant for Tunisia, and
            elsewhere. Hence the following lessons are suggested.
            Regardless of success, it is disappointing to observe the
            lack of clear focus in design, and implementation as it
            regards poverty reduction, since contrary to the Bank's
            mission statement towards poverty alleviation, high income
            areas were instead chosen for investment. Remedial action
            should specifically, and explicitly target the poor in
            future operations, disseminating this priority among
            municipalities, early on during implementation, and
            reinforcing the work successfully begun in Kasserine.
            Furthermore, questions arise on the extent of resource
            mobilization by municipal administrations, and if it means
            local, and social development, or, whether improved
            pavements alleviate poverty, particularly regarding
            investments in urban areas. Suggestions include a clearly
            defined baseline of municipal development conditions at the
            outset, followed by accountability for development outcomes,
            and feedback mechanisms to report improvements, rigorously
            emphasizing economic evaluation of project investments. ",Country :  Tunisia,Content Type : Reports,"June 26, 2000

Georgia: Secondary and Local Roads Project and Kakheti Regional Roads Improvement Project (PPAR), PDF file,"Trade is important for Georgia’s economy, and good transport links are essential to promote and sustain it. Roads are the main mode of transport in the country. Therefore, upgrading and managing roads adequately is vital to sustained economic growth. These two projects were the first World Bank projects that focused on secondary and local roads in the country. Previous operations focused on highways and other transport modes. Secondary and local roads both support the country’s economy by providing access to agriculture areas and tourism sites and are important to improving people’s living standards by facilitating access to markets and services, for example. The key finding of this Project Performance Assessment Report is that the two projects contributed to improved road management in Georgia linked to strong government commitment and continuous World Bank support, though results were limited for certain project components mainly because of design and implementation shortcomings.

Ratings for the Secondary and Local Roads Project are as follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was moderate. Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Kakheti Regional Roads Improvement Project ratings are as follows: Outcome was satisfactory,  Risk to development outcome was modest, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. This assessment offers the following key lessons of experience: (i) It is impossible to implement a holistic road safety approach through a small, regional project without the formal involvement of key road safety stakeholders, (ii) A sustained engagement on road safety over time can help transform the road safety culture in a country, (iii) Upgrading a road that is barely passable can make it less safe despite the implementation of road safety engineering measures. (iv) Measuring improved road safety resulting from project interventions requires a carefully designed approach. (v) The successful introduction of performance-based maintenance and rehabilitation contracts requires contractors to be aware of the paradigm shift such contracts imply to avoid financial losses.

"Yemen - Multi-Mode Transport, Transport Rehabilitation, Privatization Support, and Second Public Works Projects", Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) covers four recently completed projects for the Republic of Yemen. The ratings of the PPAR generally concur with the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) ratings, except for the following instances: Multi-mode Transport Project- outcome (ICR satisfactory, PPAR moderately satisfactory) and sustainability (ICR unlikely, PPAR likely); Transport Rehabilitation Project- outcome (ICR satisfactory, PPAR moderately satisfactory); Privatization Support Project- Bank and borrower performance, unrated by the ICR, in the PPAR they are satisfactory and unsatisfactory respectively; and the Second Public Works Project - Bank performance (ICR satisfactory, PPAR highly satisfactory). Four primary lessons were learned. In a post conflict, country unification situation additional risk analysis is appropriate to ensure that the government is fully committed to the reforms proposed and the timetable for the reform agenda. Project objectives should be framed realistically, taking into account the borrower's ability to achieve stakeholder support for proposed changes. Genuine community ownership and participation can enhance the likelihood of project success. Inter-ministerial, agency and stakeholder coordination are crucial to project sustainability and that the Bank could be more proactive in helping to improve the general level of coordination.", ,Content Type : Reports,"October 27, 2004

Solomon Islands - First Phase of Development Policy Operation Project, Web Resource,"Ratings for the Planning and

            risk to development outcome was negligible to low, the Bank
            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower
            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons
            learned included: consistency and stability of personnel are
            important. In this case, turnover of both
            consultants/advisors and task team leaders negatively
            impacted project performance at various stages of
            implementation. A modest initial project scope, producing
            quick and demonstrable wins, can be preferable to early
            ambition. In this case, the complexity of planned activities
            and results matrix overwhelmed staff with limited capacity,
            necessitating restructuring to streamline. Deliberate and
            focused attention to balancing the implementation and
            capacity building roles of external technical advisors is
            critical for long-term success. In this case, the advisors

            and Sewerage Project (IZWSS) is rated highly satisfactory,
            its sustainability is unlikely, and, the Istanbul Water
            Supply and Sewerage (ISWSS) and, Ankara Sewerage Projects
            (ASP) are found satisfactory, but sustainability is
            uncertain. Additionally, the Bank, and Borrower performances
            were found unsatisfactory in both the IZWSS and ISWSS, but
            satisfactory in the ASP case. Most importantly, the combined
            audit identifies significant lessons for sector dialogue,
            given an unclear future assistance in the sector. The
            ineffective sector development strategy confirms excessive
            political interference, which has created financial
            difficulties for all three projects, indicating the need for
            strong management capacity, and greater private sector

            systems of water utilities, to monitor tariff levels, and
            operational efficiency for sustainability of private sector
            participation, which warrants reform of the sector's

            improvements in fiscal administration. Divergence of

Burkina Faso - Structural Adjustment and Economic Recovery Credit Projects, Web Resource,"The Structural Adjustment Credit
            (SAC) Project outcome is rated as marginally satisfactory,
            its institutional development impact modest, and its
            sustainability uncertain based on the mixed implementation
            of the program: the slow rate of reform in the civil
            service; the public investment program and the environment
            for private sector development; and the slow progress in
            raising the efficiency of the Burkinabe economy. The
            Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) is rated as Satisfactory with
            uncertain sustainability, and modest institutional
            development impact. World Bank and Borrower performances for
            both projects are rated satisfactory, despite some
            shortcomings. The key lesson from these projects is that the
            constraints to reform-including government capacity and
            ownership and the degree of support in the country, more
            broadly-must be appraised realistically. Slower than
            expected implementation can lead to a loss of internal
            coherence in the program, delay in concrete results, and
            adverse political reactions. Fast disbursing loans are not
            always well-suited to supporting reforms which require
            long-term monitoring and supervision. Burkina's
            experience again confirms that resorting to internal wage
            and price compression as the means to redress external
            economic imbalance is typically incompatible with rapid
            economic recovery and can be very costly in economic and
            social terms. Finally, the Bank's experience suggests
            that elaborate technical assistance programs with numerous

Cote d'Ivoire - Energy Sector Adjustment Loan, Web Resource,"The Energy Sector Adjustment Loan for
            Cote d'Ivoire was marginally satisfactory. The project
            achieved some of its objectives, its impact on institutional
            development was modest, sustainability is uncertain, and the
            performance of both the Bank and Borrower was mixed. Several
            lessons can be learned from this project. First, SECALs are
            inappropriate for complex and slow institutional, financial,
            and managerial reform programs. Second, it is important for
            executing agencies to have ""ownership"" of the
            reform program. Third, private management contracts for
            public utilities are no panacea and can give rise to new
            problems and costs. Fourth, it is more advisable to opt for
            full privatization involving asset sales or a full-blown
            ""concession"" contract when the private operator is
            also responsible for all new investment in the sector.
            Finally, a fully transparent and competitive privatization
            process appears to be incompatible with the rapidity of
            decisions and political realities in many countries, where
            public acceptance of privatization has yet to gain

China - Shanghai Sewerage Project and Liaoning Urban Infrastructure Project, Web Resource,"This audit report rated the outcome
            of both the Shanghai Sewerage Project and the Liaoning
            Project as satisfactory. Both projects demonstrate the
            importance of a good match between project objectives and
            respective components for achieving realistic and meaningful
            results. For the Shanghai project, key lessons are: 1)
            Institutional development is a slow process that requires
            careful design suitable to the particular enabling
            environment. 2) The programs involving physical works and
            institutional and financial development require a balanced
            implementation plan of the whole utility, which should be
            supported through appropriately designed and timed
            convenants. 4) The Bank can play a meaningful role in
            supporting large-scale urban infrastructure by encouraging
            borrowers to pay attention to institutional and financial
            reforms. 5) To attract international contractors in similar
            lending operations in the future, there may be a strong case
            for large management contracts moving toward program
            lending. Key lessons from the Liaoning project are: 1)
            Project designs must link institutional development to
            appropriate incentives and action plans early in the
            project. 2) Contracts of longer than one year must contain
            price escalation clauses. 3) The International Competitive
            Bidding contract ceiling of US$3 million for civil works
            contracts in China was too low to attract foreign bidders.

China - Second Tianjin Urban Development and Environment Project and Chongqing Small Cities Infrastructure Improvement Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report assesses two urban development projects in China, the Second Tianjin Urban Development and Environment Project (2003 to 2012) and the Chongqing Small Cities Infrastructure Improvement Project (2005 to 2012). Notably, findings from this report will inform IEG's upcoming evaluation of Bank Group performance on poverty reduction, specifically on tackling urban poverty. The unprecedented scale of urbanization in China and the accompanying increasing demands for urban services form the backdrop to this evaluation. Tianjin and Chongqing have the status of provinces, but are administered directly by the central government. Both operations sought to address the key question of how to improve urban services for a rapidly growing population. The Tianjin-II project's objective set out to assist Tianjin in enhancing the efficiency and equity of wastewater management and transportation system aimed at Tianjin's sustainable development; however, the concepts of efficiency and equity were undefined. The overall outcome of the project is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The Chongqing Small Cities Infrastructure Improvement Project objective was to support emerging small cities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of infrastructure service delivery, to accommodate rapid urban growth. The overall outcome of the project is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Common lessons from both projects include, (i) Great care is needed in project preparation and appraisal to ensure that all proposed interventions are feasible. In the case of the Tianjin-II project, some originally designed components and activities were cancelled or modified because the feasibility studies showed that these activities were not feasible. The changes led to project restructuring and implementation delays. (ii) A well-phrased and clearly defined project development objective (PDO) statement and a comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework is a key step towards a results-focused Bank operation. Both the Tianjin-II and Chongqing Small Cities projects face similar challenges of PDOs that are not clearly defined and non-comprehensive M&E frameworks, making it difficult to monitor and assess the project implementation progress towards achieving the development objectives. IEG's interaction with task team leaders across the Bank suggests that phrasing an accurate and relevant PDO appears to be a common challenge. (iii) By continuing to tailor its services and instruments to the more localized needs and capacity of the Borrower, the Bank can maintain the effectiveness of its support. The interaction with local officers in Tianjin and Chongqing suggested that there is still strong demand for the Bank's support in urban development in China. However, in more developed urban areas like Tianjin, demand is mainly for the Bank's innovation and knowledge rather than the Bank's financing. For less developed urban areas like the secondary cities in Chongqing, the Bank's financing and project management experiences with special attention to environment and vulnerable groups, are very much appreciated. (iv) While the Bank's engagement has supported the development in China, its prolonged internal decision-making processes may decrease its competitiveness in helping address fast-paced changes. In the case of Tianjin-II, the project implementation often could not keep up with local development, resulting in the cancelation of project activities. Such an experience is quite common across the Bank's projects in China. Inefficiency on the Bank side is often cited by both parties as the main reason. The client suggested that the Bank could become more efficient through simplifying procedures and granting more authority to Bank task team leaders, who could make more timely decisions to accelerate project implementation.

Russia: Bank Assistance for Public Sector Management and Governance (Russian), PDF file,"The Bank's assistance strategy to the Russian Federation has placed increasingly more emphasis on reforms in the area of public sector management since 1997. The 1997 CAS pointed to problems inhibiting the development of the private sector, including crime, corruption, noncompetitive access to business premises and urban land, lack of a legal framework for secured lending, difficulties in contract enforcement, and arbitrary practices of tax and customs authorities. It went on to reiterate the actions undertaken by the government in the area of better governance, such as in fiscal management, expenditure realignment, improvement of the treasury system, and consolidation of some off-budget operations.",Country :  Russian Federation,Content Type : Reports,"September 10, 2002

How to Build M&E Systems to Support Better Government, Web Resource,"A growing number of governments are working to improve their performance by creating systems to measure and help them understand their performance. These systems for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) are used to measure the quantity, quality, and targeting of the goods and servicesâ the outputsâthat the state provides and to measure the outcomes and impacts resulting from these outputs. These systems are also a vehicle to facilitate understanding of the causes of good and poor performance. There are many reasons for the increasing efforts to strengthen government M&E systems. Fiscal pressures and ever-rising expectations from ordinary citizens provide a continuing impetus for governments to provide more government services and with higher standards of quality. These pressures are also reason enough to find more costeffective ways of operating so that governments can do more with less. Countries in the developing world often look to the richest countriesâthe members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)âand adopt the public sector management tools that these countries typically employ, such as M&E and performance budgeting. Civil society and parliaments are also putting accountability pressures on governments to publicly report and explain their performances. And international donors are being pressed to demonstrate the results of the large volumes of aid spending for which they are responsible; they in turn are working to persuade and support developing countries to strengthen their own M&E systems.", ,Content Type : Reports,"July 18, 2007

"Ghana - First, Second, and Third Natural Resources and Environmental Governance Development Policy Operations Project", Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report assesses the First, Second, and Third Ghana Natural Resource and Environmental Governance Development Policy Credits (June 2008 through June 2011). Together they represent a completed Programmatic Development Policy Operation series, and this review assesses the Program as a whole. Government's Natural Resources and Environmental Governance Program (NREG) represented an innovative effort to bring a new approach to a set of challenging subsectors, and to do so in a harmonized manner with other major development partners. The Program supported efforts to improve environmental and natural resource management under three Policy Areas, (i) Forest and Wildlife; (ii) Mining; and (iii) Environmental Protection. The Program development objectives of the series were to (a) ensure predictable and sustainable financing for the forest and wildlife sectors and effective forest law enforcement; (b) improve mining sector revenue collection, management, and transparency; ( c) address social issues in forest and mining communities, and (d) mainstream environment into economic growth. The Program's overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The experience of NREG offers a number of useful lessons about using development policy operations for sectoral interventions, about donor harmonization, and about natural resource management. These include, (i) earmarking funds to specific agencies can undermine the rationale of a development policy operation by inserting the Bank into the relationship between the finance ministry and the line ministries and their agencies; (ii) there is a risk that in sectoral development policy operations with one-year operational cycles, policy and technical advice to the client can be crowded out by processing requirements; (iii) sectoral development policy operations may need complementary technical assistance and support; and (iv) donor harmonization has tradeoffs: it can help to provide a unified platform for sector reform, but can reduce the flexibility of programs, and differences in rules and expectations across agencies pose significant challenges.

            Credit for Nepal was rated marginally satisfactory. The
            project achieved some of its objectives, its impact on
            institutional development was modest, sustainability is
            uncertain, and both the Bank and Borrower performed
            adequately. Several lessons can be learned from this
            project. First, IDA should have designed the project to pay
            greater attention to the country's institutional
            weakness and limited political support for measures that
            affect vested interests. Second, excessive reliance on
            foreign consultants resulted in the production of thick
            volumes and manuals that nobody used, but had negligible
            lasting impacts on local institutions. Third, efforts at
            improving coordination among donors were not successful
            because of the waste of resources, duplication of efforts,
            and territory disputes. Fourth, it was premature to include
            financial sector reforms in the absence of specific
            knowledge regarding the exact nature of the needed measures.
            Fifth, during the design of the credit, greater efforts
            should have been made to ensure the participation of the
            Borrower, including line ministries and agencies. Sixth,
            conditionality should have been better defined, calling for
            more specific measures rather than studies. Finally, one
            should weigh the importance/effectiveness of the measures

Mauritania - Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment Program Project, Web Resource,"The Operations Evaluation Department
            (OED) did an assessment of the Public Enterprise Sector
            Adjustment Program (PESAP) in 1996 (See PPAR report no.
            15832). The purpose of reassessing the PESAP is to test the
            durability of its results, that is, whether the findings of
            an evaluation change if the operation is evaluated after a
            longer interval, in this case in 2003 rather than in 1996.
            The reassessment focuses on the initial evaluation findings,
            facts that have emerged since the evaluation, and the
            current assessment in 2003. The exercise is important for
            the reliability and credibility of OED's evaluations
            and could help determine which OED should undertake
            assessment of certain operations, especially adjustment
            programs. The outcome of the PESAP is rated satisfactory as
            in the 1996 PPAFL Although the institutional development
            impact of Bank assistance as a whole in the Public
            Enterprise sector has been substantial, the impact of the
            PESAP on institutional development has been modest, compared
            to moderate in the 1996 PPAR. The sustainability is rated
            likely, compared to uncertain in the PPAR. Bank and Borrower
            performances are rated satisfactory, as in the PPAR. The
            following lessons of general applicability emerge from this
            re-assessment: 1) The reform of the parapublic sector is a
            very long process measured in decades rather than in years.
            Its outcome in economic terms and impact on private sector
            development take many years to materialize. Issues are
            numerous and complex: legal, social, financial, etc. Bank
            country assistance strategies and projects should plan
            public enterprise reforms over a long period of time. 2)
            Proper sequencing in PE reforms is critical. The first step
            should be streamlining and strengthening the legal and
            institutional framework. 3) To move from a phase of
            rehabilitation/restructuring to a phase of privatization or
            public-private partnership is a big step and may represent
            for some governments a difficult and delicate decision.
            Continuous Bank support is essential. 4) A broad PE reform
            managed and monitored at the central level should be
            complemented by sector reform supported by technical
            assistance projects, especially in the case of public
            utilities. 5) In PE reforms, performance agreements may be
            valuable tools in the rehabilitation and restructuring
            phase, but their purpose is limited and their success highly
            dependent on the commitment and independence of each side.
            6) The setting up of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
            system is essential to monitor PEs' operational and
            financial performance in a consistent manner and over a
            length of time. It also requires a staff capable of
            analyzing data. Bank projects should pay particular
            attention to this at preparation/appraisal. ",Country :  Mauritania,Content Type : Reports,"May 27, 2004

            outcomes of the SAL/SAC were rated as highly unsatisfactory
            and that of the ERC was marginally satisfactory. The lessons
            drawn from the SAL/SAC are: 1) It was a mistake to launch a
            wide-ranging and detailed structural adjustment program
            during an unresolved balance-of-payment crisis. 2) Greater
            sensitivity is required to the adjustment needs of
            developing countries tied to large countries by fixed
            exchange rates. 3) Structural adjustment is hard to be
            successful when the government's ownership and public
            understanding of how to improve the country's economic
            situation are lacking. 4) Policies can be altered more
            readily than politically entrenched institutions can be
            transformed, or laws modified. 5) Structural adjustment,
            especially in Africa, is extremely difficult, highly
            resource-intensive, and time-consuming to implement in
            practice. 6) Frequent Bank staff changes disrupt project
            continuity. The chief lessons from the ERC are: 1) Reforms
            can be more readily implemented in an improving economic
            climate. 2) The Bank should make clear from the outset that
            the structural conditions need to be fulfilled promptly. 3)

This long period covers the last years of economic decline experienced by Ukraine throughout the decade of the 1990s, as well as a period of strong recovery, starting in 2000 and continuing until 2006. 
The World Bank assistance strategy during this decade also changed substantially. In particular, the Bankâs approach to adjustment lending in Ukraine changed from one based on a variety of sector adjustment loans (SECALs) to one based on a series of multi-sector Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PALs). 
This PPAR confirms that the outcome of the three operations assessed was Satisfactory, although there were shortcomings in some areas. In two cases, the shortcomings reflected an underestimation of the political difficulty of the reforms on the part of the World Bank, led to delays in tranche releases, and required waivers.

Building Biodiversity Governance Through Stakeholder Participation, PDF file,"According to the World Resources Institute, at current rates of deforestation and land clearance, 5 to 10 percent of tropical forest biodiversity will vanish over the next three decades. There are many pressures on biodiversity in developing countries, but the core of the problem is competition between resource uses. Protected areas often are endowed with natural resources as varied as timber, oil, and minerals. The land itself is coveted by farmers or herders crowded off existing cleared land or simply looking to expand. Protected areas are also often home to indigenous peoples and others who depend on forest resources for their livelihoods. The complexity of the governance issues involved in reconciling biodiversity conservation with competing interests makes it very difficult to manage protected areas and the resources they contain.", ,Content Type : Reports,"November 4, 2002

Cambodia: World Bank Country-Level Engagement on Governance and Anticorruption (Working Paper), PDF file,"Cambodia is one of the world's most open economies, sustaining high levels of growth in an environment of relatively weak governance. Emerging from a legacy of genocide and civil conflict, the country has sought to address human and social capital deficits across sectors,
weaknesses in public finance, and corruption. Despite improvements in access to basic services, governance constraints persist and may threaten gains from economic integration.

Over the 2004-10 period, the Bank's engagement on Governance and Anticorruption (GAC) issues in Cambodia was not defined by a single, overarching priority or entry point (such as core public sector management, natural resource management, or service delivery). Rather, the World Bank was opportunistic, opting to support the government's GAC efforts across multiple sectors and institutions. The relevance of this opportunistic approach is judged to be moderately relevant. The Bank's objectives on public financial management (PFM) were highly relevant given Cambodia's nontransparent and weak public expenditure management and limited capacity.",Country :  Cambodia,Content Type : Reports,"December 1, 2011

Morocco - Municipal Solid Waste Sector Development Policy Loans 1-4, Web Resource,"Ratings for Loans 1 and 2 of the
            Municipal Solid Waste Sector Development Policy were as
            follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to
            development outcome was significant, Bank performance was
            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.
            Ratings for Loans 3 and 4 were as follows: Outcome was
            satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was significant,
            Bank performance was satisfactory, Borrower performance was
            satisfactory. This assessment offers the following lessons:
            (i) A policy loan can be a viable instrument to start
            reforms in the MSWM sector, cover multiple aspects, and
            obtain the government’s sustained attention and commitment
            for a nationwide program. However, because of the sector’s
            complexity, with many actors involved at the national and
            local levels, these reforms require long-term engagement
            using various instruments. (ii) Continued attention to
            strengthening municipalities, both financially and
            institutionally, is key to enabling them to fulfill their
            service provision mandate on SWM sustainably. (iii)
            Behavioral change and leveraging technology are critically
            needed to establish separation at source and promote waste
            reduction, reuse, and recycling, promoting the evolution
            into a circular economy and ensuring environmental
            sustainability. (iv) Integrated upstream interventions
            including policy reforms, incentives and investments for
            circular economy (along with focus on collection and
            disposal) are needed to achieve sustainable solid waste
            management systems. (v) Scaling up the formalization of

"Serbia - Consolidated Collection and Pension Administration Reform, and Delivery of Improved Local Services Projects", Web Resource ,"Following the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia and a series of regional wars, the Federation of the Republics of Serbia and Montenegro rejoined the World Bank in 2001. Serbia experienced solid growth during 2000–2008, followed by a series of severe recessions combined with rapidly rising unemployment and growing public debt over 2008–2014. To improve its growth prospects Serbia embarked on several structural reforms between 2014 and 2017. Growth fundamentals and prospects are now sound, and the underlying growth trend is vibrant. Serbia is at a late stage of demographic transition, characterized by a total fertility rate well below the population replacement rate, and an aging and shrinking population. Demographic and population changes have clear implications for the delivery of health, education, and social assistance services, and for the sustainability of the pension system. In the meantime, Roma, having a much higher total fertility rate, are going to represent a growing percentage of the total Serbian population and the future workforce. This PPAR covers two projects. The first, Consolidated Collection and Pension Administration Reform Project (PARP) and was put in place to (i) develop the framework for the consolidation of collection of all social contributions and, if feasible, personal income taxes; and to (ii) improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the pension system through modernizing and streamlining the institutional capacity in the pension system; improved pension system administration; developing the capacity for policy identification and analysis; monitoring; and increased public understanding of the pension system. The second, Delivery of Improved Local Services Project (DILS) aimed to improve the local delivery of health, education, and social assistance services.

Ratings for the PARP project are as follows: Outcome is moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome is moderate, Bank and Borrower performance are both moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the DILS project are as follows: Outcome is moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome is moderate, and Bank and Borrower performance are both moderately satisfactory. Eight lessons that could help improve future World Bank operations are identified. The first lesson arises from both projects, followed by three lessons from PARP and four lessons from the DILS project. (i) Clarity around the overall vision and data architecture is needed for successful MIS investments. (ii) A stakeholder analysis can be a useful tool to identify potential supporters and resistance when reforms involve several actors. (iii) The tax administration can be usefully included in the administrative reform process. (iv) Rationalizing the social insurance system takes time. (v) Multisector projects have the advantage of providing bridge financing that allows continuity and deepening of reforms policy, but this design feature may negatively affect other project ratings. (vi) Activities carried out by entities with a clear institutional status can be better sustained than those implemented by ad-hoc bodies. (vii) The employment of contractual staff (consultants) in the project implementation unit does not build sustainable capacity in the ministries. (viii) Projects that aim at strengthening locally delivered services should ensure alignment between local functions, capacities, and financing to succeed.

Mobilizing Disruptive and Transformative Technologies for Development An Assessment of the World Bank Group’s Readiness (Approach Paper), PDF file,"The world is experiencing a technological revolution with far reaching implications for developing and developed countries. Technological disruption is not new, but the speed at which new technologies are emerging is unprecedented, and so is their diffusion across the global economy. Disruptive technologies can transform development – in both positive and negative ways – and result in new paradigms for poverty reduction and boosting shared prosperity. Recognizing these positive and negative implications, and with a sense of urgency to position itself to help client countries mobilize disruptive technologies for their development, the Bank Group has adopted a new approach. This evaluation has a two‐fold purpose: first, to assess the Bank Group’s readiness in helping clients harness the opportunities and mitigate the risks posed by disruptive technologies; and second, to inform the implementation of the Bank Group’s new approach to disruptive technologies and its efforts to become a partner of choice in mobilizing disruptive technologies.", ,Content Type : Reports,"May 31, 2019

Moldova: World Bank Country-Level Engagement on Governance and Anticorruption (Working Paper), PDF file,"Moldova has suffered over the last two decades from rising poverty, territorial secession, armed conflict, and the spillover effects of a regional financial crisis, with declining population size and life expectancy, and an economy approximately one-half of what it was
in 1990. The return of the Moldovan Communist Party (PCRM), which won two major elections after 2001, contributed to increasing centralization of governmental authority along with a reform agenda that emphasized greater state control over the economy, fiscal support
to state enterprises and collective farms, land consolidation, economic protectionism, and the tolerance of monopolies in industry and energy. 

At the same time, the government has increased social expenditures, and taken major steps to improve public financial management.
Governance was a centerpiece of the Bank's country strategies in Moldova. The Moldova country program has appropriately adopted opportunistic approaches to address ongoing political uncertainty, although the Bank missed opportunities to strengthen civil society
organizations (CSOs) as a natural constituency for good governance. At the sector level, the Bank's engagement was highly relevant for public sector governance given the institutional fragilities in the public administration system. Engagement in primary education was relevant
in addressing key constraints. Bank engagement in the road sector used GAC issues to set a sustainable framework for policy dialogue, investment, maintenance planning, regulation and safety.",Country :  Moldova,Content Type : Reports,"December 1, 2011

Overall, the evaluation finds that the reforms supported by the Bank's operations strengthened the financial sectors of the four focus countries and helped them resist the impact of the financial crisis of 2008-2009. In all the countries the financial systems are still bank-oriented but the banking sector is much stronger and generally in a better position to respond to the financing needs of the private sector.", ,Content Type : Reports,"June 26, 2012

"Tanzania - Agricultural Sector Management Project (ASMP), the Second Agricultural Research Project (TARP II), and the Second National Agricultural Extension Project (NAEP II)", Web Resource ,"This evaluation finds mixed performance overall. The outcome of the Agricultural Sector Management Project (ASMP) is rated moderately satisfactory. The outcome of the Second Agricultural Research Project (TARP II) is rated moderately unsatisfactory mainly on the grounds that the evidence suggests only modest efficiency in a project in which efficiency was a key objective. The outcome of the National Agricultural Extension Project II (NAEP II) is rated unsatisfactory due to modest relevance, efficacy and efficiency. Five main lessons are drawn from both the project assessments and the sector review: (1) There needs to be an explicit logical link between the strategic and sectoral goals of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the proposed lending program. (2) Institutional capacity analysis could be strengthened and broadened and chronic problems that persist in a sector over long periods of time should result in more analytical work by the Bank. (3) In policy research, there needs to be a balance between shorter-term client-oriented adaptive research and longer-term core applied research and this needs to be embedded in a regional approach. (4) The Bank needs to be more realistic in projecting timescales for agricultural reforms. (5) The Bank and the borrowers should be more realistic about the likelihood of funds saved from the down-sizing of a public institution being applied to future operating costs.",Country :  Tanzania,Content Type : Reports,"June 18, 2007

            L’objectif de sa réévaluation
            aujourd’hui consiste à tester la
            durabilité de ses résultats,
            c’est-à-dire, à savoir si les

            différents si l’opération est
            évaluée après un laps de temps
            plus long, dans ce cas en 2003 plutôt
            qu’en 1996. La réévaluation

            événements qui se sont produits depuis
            cette évaluation et à
            l’évaluation en cours en 2003.

            l’impact du développement institutionnel

            l’impact du Programme d’ajustement du

            été modeste, alors qu’il

            l’emprunteur sont qualifiées de
            satisfaisantes comme dans le PPAR. Les leçons
            suivantes relatives à
            l’applicabilité
            générale peuvent être
            tirées de cette réévaluation : 1)
            la réforme du secteur parapublique est un processus
            très long mesuré en décennies
            plutôt qu’en années. Son
            résultat en termes économiques et son
            impact sur le développement du secteur
            privé se matérialisent au bout de
            nombreuses années. Les problèmes sont
            nombreux et complexes : d’ordre juridique, social,
            financier, etc. Les stratégies
            d’aide-pays et les projets de la Banque devraient
            prévoir les réformes des entreprises
            publiques sur des laps de temps prolongés. 2) Il
            est crucial de réaliser les réformes des
            entreprises publiques dans un ordre adéquat. La
            première étape devrait être la
            simplification et le renforcement du cadre juridique et
            institutionnel. 3) Le passage d’une phase
            d’amélioration/restructuration à
            une phase de privatisation ou de partenariat
            public/privé est un grand pas à franchir
            et peut représenter une décision difficile
            et délicate pour certains gouvernements. Le soutien
            permanent de la Banque est indispensable. 4) Une large
            réforme des entreprises publiques
            gérée et suivie au niveau central doit
            être complétée par une
            réforme du secteur appuyée par des projets
            d’assistance technique, en particulier dans le cas
            des services publics. 5) Dans les réformes des
            entreprises publiques, les accords de performance peuvent
            être des outils précieux pendant la phase
            d’amélioration et de restructuration,
            mais leur utilité est limitée et leur
            succès dépend grandement de
            l’engagement et de
            l’indépendance de chacune des parties. 6)
            La mise en place d’un système de suivi et
            d’évaluation (S&E) est indispensable
            pour suivre la performance opérationnelle et
            financière des entreprises publiques
            d’une manière cohérente au fil
            du temps. Elle exige aussi de pouvoir compter sur un
            personnel capable d’analyser les données.

Azerbaijan: World Bank Country-Level Engagement on Governance and Anticorruption (Working Paper), PDF file,"Azerbaijan is a secular, majority-Shiite, oil and gas-rich country whose per-capita income quadrupled in real terms during the period 2004â10. While rising incomes have reduced poverty, steps towards a more secure, diversified economy are held back by a public sector
that rests on vested interests, patronage-based incentive structures, and ingrained patterns of behavior that include significant rent extraction, particularly from the non-oil economy, with minimal checks and balances from Parliament, the private sector, and civil society.

World Bank engagement in Azerbaijan at the country level focused on areas which had government support. Some modest results have been achieved, even though in many cases modern laws and practices were adopted without adequate plans for implementation. At the project level,
the Bank has supported the strengthening of project implementation units (PIUs) and tools for monitoring, and governance and institutional filters have signaled that Governance and Anticorruption (GAC) processes need to be embedded in the Bank projects. At the sector
level, the Bank's work was highly relevant in supporting oil revenue transparency, primary education, roads, and the development of safeguards. It was substantially relevant in public financial management, and private sector development and procurement.

Ten Key Issues for Diagnosis of a Government's M&E Systems, Web Resource,"1. Genesis of the existing M&E system: role of M&E advocates or champions; key events which created the priority for M&E information (e.g., election of reform-oriented government, fiscal crisis).
	 
2. The ministry or agency responsible for managing the M&E system, and for planning evaluations. Roles and responsibilities of the main parties to the M&E system â e.g., finance ministry, planning ministry, president's office, sector ministries, parliament or congress. Incentives for the stakeholders to take M&E seriously â strength of demand for M&E information. Possible existence of several, uncoordinated M&E systems, at the national and sectoral levels. Importance of federal/state/local issues to the M&E system.
	 
3.The public sector environment and whether it makes it easy or difficult for managers to perform to high standards, and to be held accountable for their performance. Are public sector reforms underway which might benefit from a stronger emphasis on the measurement of government performance, such as a poverty reduction strategy, performance budgeting, strengthening policy analysis skills, creation of a performance culture in the civil service, improvements in service delivery such as customer service standards, government decentralization, greater participation by civil society, or an anti-corruption strategy?
	 
4. The main aspects of public sector management which the M&E system supports strongly, such as: (i) budget decision-making; (ii) national or sectoral planning; (iii) program management; (iv) accountability relationships (to the finance ministry, to the President's office, to parliament, to sector ministries, to civil society).
	 
5. Actual role of M&E information at the various stages of the budget process â such as policy advising and planning; budget decision-making; performance review and reporting. Possible disconnect between the M&E work of sector ministries and the use of such information in the budget process. Existence of any disconnect between the budget process and national planning. Opportunities to strengthen the role of M&E in the budget.
	 
6. Extent to which the M&E information commissioned by key stakeholders (e.g. the finance ministry) is used by others, such as sector ministries. If not, what are the barriers to utilization? Any solid evidence concerning the extent of utilization by different stakeholders (e.g., a diagnostic review or a survey). Examples of major evaluations which have been highly influential with the government.
	 
7. Types of M&E tool which are emphasized in the M&E system: regular performance indicators; rapid reviews or evaluations; performance audits; rigorous, in-depth impact evaluations; other. Scale and cost of each of these types of M&E. Manner in which evaluation priorities are set â are they focused on 'problem programs', pilot programs, high-expenditure or high-visibility programs, or are they based on a systematic research agenda to answer questions about program effectiveness?
	 
8. Who is responsible for collecting performance information, and for conducting evaluations (e.g., ministries themselves, or academia or consulting firms)? Any problems with data quality or reliability, or with the quality of evaluations which have been conducted. Strengths and weaknesses of local supply of M&E.

Liberia: World Bank Country-Level Engagement on Governance and Anticorruption  (Working Paper), PDF file,"The World Bank reengaged in Liberia in 2004, following more than a decade of conflict during which a quarter of a million people perished, per capita GDP contracted from $890 (1980) to $190 (2007), virtually all public infrastructure and services were decimated, and the country's 3.6 million citizens faced a national debt exceeding $4.7 billion. That debt was finally resolved in 2010, the country's economy has grown steadily since 2004, and two national elections have.

 The World Bank's effectiveness in addressing GAC issues at the country level in Liberia has been limited by a number of factors. First, the absence of an overall state-building strategy ensures that Bank support for GAC remains disjointed. An initial focus on quickly building PFM capacity was justified to expedite emergency funding, but a more coherent and effective approach to GAC across the country portfolio has not emerged in the six years since the new government came to power. Second, the Bank's approach to building capacity for governance is dominated by âinward lookingâ sectoral support, especially since 2007. Incentives have not been provided to induce cross-sectoral approaches.",Country :  Liberia,Content Type : Reports,"December 1, 2011

Subsequent debt rescheduling and improvements in macro management have also reduced the threat of default. Even though debt service levels remain high, sustainability of these net benefits is rated likely. SAL's outcome is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. Improvements in loan repayment have been sustained and are likely to continue. Even though debt service levels remain high, sustainability of these net benefits is rated likely. Overall, outcome of SAC I is rated satisfactory, and sustainability of project achievements is likely. The overall outcome of SAC II is rated as moderately satisfactory, and sustainability of net project benefits is rated likely. SAC II had important institutional objectives in tax administration, public financial management, civil service reform, procurement, and utility restructuring and regulation. The main lessons from these loans are: 1) Effectiveness of a series of one-tranche loans depends on a willingness to withhold lending until a critical mass of previously-agreed prior actions have been undertaken. The delay between the SAL and the first SAC was particularly effective in this respect.2) Complex or politically difficult sector reforms are best supported through dedicated sector operations. A multi-sector operation can play only a secondary or facilitating role when dealing with institutional development (as in tax reform or civil service reform), deep-rooted reluctance to reform (as in power), need for specific funding to offset costs of adjustment (as in banking), or weak service delivery (as in health and education).",Country :  Pakistan,Content Type : Reports,"December 19, 2005

Well-functioning accounting and financial management systems are among the basics that facilitate this, and significant resources and time have been invested for the procurement and implementation of such systems across the world.

"Uganda - First, Second, Third, and Fourth Poverty Reduction Support Credit Projects", Web Resource ,"This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for four Poverty Reduction Support Credit projects (PRSCs) in Uganda. After about 25 years of economic turmoil and conflict which ended in 1986, Uganda adopted policies that brought about economic stability and growth. Fiscal discipline was a central element of the program, as well as an increased reliance on markets and the opening of the economy.  The PRSCs aimed to achieve these objectives by helping to: (a) promote an efficient and equitable use o f public resources; (b) improve service delivery through cross-cutting reforms; (c) promote an enabling environment for rural development; and (d) improve delivery o f basic services.
The review concludes that the PRSCs had substantial relevance and modest efficacy. IEG rates overall relevance as substantial for all PRSCs, but PRSC3 whose relevance was modest because of its weak design. Overall efficacy was modest, except for PRSC4 which was negligible, because the expected outcomes did not materialize even though most prior-actions and triggers were met. As a result, the review rates the outcome for PRSC 1-2 moderately satisfactory and the outcome for PRSC3-4 as moderately unsatisfactory.",Country :  Uganda,Content Type : Reports,"June 22, 2009

Evaluation of the World Bank Group Engagement on Strengthening Subnational Governments (Approach Paper), PDF file,"
	
		
			
			Decentralization has been at the center of the public policy reform agenda all over the world - a process driven by both economic and political factors. Long-run structural transformations – mainly economic development and urbanization – have been associated with increasing demand for the provision of public services at the local level, especially in rapidly growing urban centers. This has often been translated into an assignment of public functions from national to subnational governments (SNGs), a process which, together with the transfer of the respective structures, systems, resources and arrangements, amounts to what is generally understood as decentralization. 

			The main objective of the proposed evaluation is to assess the role and contributions of the WBG to the strengthening of subnational governments (SSNG)’ ability to fulfill their public service provision responsibilities. The evaluation will focus on WBG support to core government policies and institutions necessary for SNG to deliver services and infrastructure. The evaluation aims at distilling lessons from past WBG engagement in these areas with a view to inform WBG strategic approaches in SSNG support. The evaluation is expected to make specific recommendations that could feed into relevant country strategies and project design. This evaluation is of strategic relevance from the perspective of implementing the Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD) approach, which called for enhancing financial leverage of the WBG. In addition to raising domestic resource mobilization, Bank and IFC support to SNGs, has been designed to create the conditions for increased private development finance at the subnational level. The potential audience for this evaluation includes WBG management, WBG task teams, clients (at national and subnational levels), development partners and practitioners.

            are not adapted to their developmental needs. Among the
            questions this paper raises, and attempts to answer, are:
            How can educational systems be reshaped to help the poorest
            segments of society How can education contribute to rural
            development, and thus respond to the needs and aspirations
            of the vast majority of the poor living in the villages How
            can educational opportunities be made more equal in order to
            promote social mobility in countries where educational
            systems have hitherto favored the urban dwellers and the

Kyrgyz Republic - The First and Second Development Policy Operations and Programmatic Governance and Competitiveness Development Policy Operation, Web Resource,"The World Bank approved two
            programmatic series of development policy operations (DPOs)
            from 2013 through 2016 to improve governance and private
            sector development in the Kyrgyz Republic. The strategic
            focus of both series’ objectives was highly relevant to the
            country context: weak governance (which had become evident
            during the 2010 revolution) and the need to shift to a
            private sector–oriented model of development to increase
            long-term economic growth. Ratings for First and Second
            Development Policy Operations are as follows: Outcome was
            moderately unsatisfactory, Risk to development outcome was
            high, and Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory.
            Ratings for the Governance and Competitiveness Development
            Policy Operation was moderately unsatisfactory for outcome,
            high for risk to development outcome, and moderately
            unsatisfactory for Bank performance. The findings of this
            Project Performance Assessment Report lead to several
            operationally relevant lessons include: (i) In a high-risk
            context, DPOs that are more targeted may have a greater
            chance of success, with implementation supported by
            complementary interventions (for example, investment
            projects and advisory services and analytics). (ii)
            Discussion of risks to the success of budget support
            operations should reflect the compounding of risks from
            parallel budget support operations. (iii) Analytics that
            take a broader view of constraints to achieving DPO
            objectives (in this case, those related to private sector
            development) are needed to ensure relevant design; more
            narrowly targeted analytics help justify specific reforms.
            (iv) The focus on governance and competitiveness was
            appropriate but raises questions regarding whether DPOs are
            the right modality in the Kyrgyz Republic to achieve reforms
            that frequently are slow to come to fruition. ",Country :  Kyrgyz Republic,Content Type : Reports,"June 7, 2022

            minimize further deterioration of the Himalayan ecosystem in
            the upper reaches of the Ganges river in the State of Uttar

Cross-cutting elements included regional integration, strengthening institutional capacity, and addressing governance, gender, and climate change challenges. The CPS was aligned with the government’s sixth national development plan 2013-2016, which aimed to accelerate infrastructure development and economic diversification, promote rural investment, accelerate poverty reduction, and enhance human development. Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) rates the CPS development outcome moderately unsatisfactory. The CLRR agrees with the CLR lessons as specified: (a) collaboration and coordination among stakeholders is critical to improving portfolio quality, (b) the number and design of projects should consider implementation capacity of the country and supervision capacity of the WBG, (c) WBG projects should be reflected in, and aligned with, the government program, (d) the WB can be effective in strengthening institutions at the local level, and (e) incorporating accountability measures in project designs promotes good governance, transparency, and oversight.",Country :  Zambia,Content Type : Reports,"February 4, 2019

Djibouti - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2009-13 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the FY2009-FY2012 Djibouti Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of FY2009, and assesses the CAS Completion Report (CASCR). The CAS was implemented by IDA.
The CAS program was aligned with the government's strategy, and its results framework mapped well into development outcomes derived from the national strategy. In this context, the CAS program aimed at supporting (i) economic growth through reducing constraints and associated costs to private sector development; (ii) access to basic social services and human development through increasing access to quality basic education, improving access to and quality of health services, and strengthening  social protection and direct support to the poor; and (iii) governance and public sector management through improving expenditure transparency, and monitoring and evaluation.
IEG rates the overall outcome of IDA support as moderately unsatisfactory. The CAS program achieved its objectives in health and education, where there was government ownership, but did not achieve them in private sector development, governance and public sector management, where government commitment was more uncertain, particularly following a change in leadership. In the areas of governance and monitoring and evaluation, the objectives of the program were not supported by appropriate Bank interventions and required capacity building. Under pillar I on growth, World Bank support helped improve access to electricity services modestly, but did not succeed in improving the efficiency of public utilities, or in opening up the telecommunications sector. Improvements in business regulations were very limited and the financial sector was strengthened by the IMF's implementation of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations. Under pillar II on basic social services and human development, Bank support fostered a substantial improvement in education and health services through government commitment, well specified programs, and good monitoring of outcomes. Expected results to strengthen social protection and direct support to the poor are taking more time than envisaged. Under pillar III on governance and public sector management, there was some progress in developing legal frameworks for improved expenditure transparency, but implementation of these frameworks is taking more time than envisaged. Progress in improving monitoring and evaluation has been very slow in the absence of good statistical systems, weak capacity and limited World Bank attention to this issue.
The experience of the World Bank's program in Djibouti shows that (i) when government ownership is unclear the likelihood of success is limited; (ii) the absence of an effective supervision system prevents timely identification and solution of problems during implementation; (iii) when there is a mismatch between objectives and interventions the program is likely to fail to achieve its objectives; (iv) weak monitoring and evaluation compounds the problems of executing a program where the interventions are weakly linked to the objectives, as was the case with governance; (v) incorporating lessons from past programs and interventions is likely to lead to more realistic outcomes; and (vi) complex results frameworks with multiple and unmeasurable indicators make it difficult to monitor the program and evaluate its impact.",Country :  Djibouti,Content Type : Reports,"March 5, 2014

            compensated over reasonable, short-term time frames for
            abstaining from using those resources until the long-term

            ensure that women benefit by addressing participation
            barriers linked to social and cultural norms. (iv)

Tajikistan - Completion and Learning Review for the Period FY15 - FY18 : IEG Review, Web Resource ,"This independent review of the World Bank Group's Completion and Learning Review (CLR) covers the period of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), FY15-FY18.The government's National Development Strategy (NDS), 2006-2015, aimed at generating sustainable growth, improving public administration, and developing human resources. The CPS original design was broadly aligned with NDS through its three focus areas: (1) strengthening the role of the private sector; (2) social inclusion; and, (3) promoting regional connectivity. The CPS design also included cross-cutting areas in gender, governance, and climate change. The CPS sought to help Tajikistan transition to a new growth model. The cost of complying with business regulation dropped, although Tajikistan continues to rank the lowest in the Central Asia region per the 2019 Doing Business report. Tax e-filing has exceeded expectations, but taxpayer satisfaction with new procedures was not assessed. The World Bank collaborated effectively with development partners in areas such as energy, water, and governance. INT received ten complaints and launched three investigations which all closed as substantiated.IEG agrees with the lessons and highlights the following: (i) overambitious objectives and/or under-emphasis of institutional impacted the success of the CPS program; (ii) with greater ownership and commitment, the government can (and does) implement “transformational projects” and achieve significant results; and, (iii) uneven governance standards, weak administration capacities, and inadequate internal review practices are constraints to swift implementation and need to be anticipated and managed proactively.IEG adds two lessons: i) A country program should identify objectives that match the level of ambition of the program and its intended results and impact; and ii) Political economy analysis of the drivers of policy reform is necessary early on to accompany implementation of ambitious goals.",Country :  Tajikistan,Content Type : Reports,"May 1, 2019

Ethiopia - Protection of Basic Services Project, Web Resource,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews the experience of the Bank in supporting Basic Services Provision in Ethiopia through the Protection of Basic Services (PBS) project, approved in May 2006 and completed in December 2009. The project objectives were (1) to ""protect the delivery of basic services by Sub-national Governments"" and (2) ""promoting and deepening transparency and accountability in service delivery."" These were to be achieved initially through four instruments: (a) providing funding for block grants that transfer resources from the federal government to the regional and district governments; (b) supporting health service provision through funding the supply of vaccines, treated bed nets, condoms and pharmaceuticals to local medical services; (c) promoting the achievement of greater financial transparency and accountability of the federal, regional and district governments through the production of timely budgets that are made publicly available and through increased citizen participation in, and understanding of, the budget process; and (d) supporting social accountability directly through engaging civil society organizations to work with citizen groups in monitoring the activities of local government.
	
	The overall outcome of the project is rated moderately satisfactory reflecting the substantial relevance and efficacy of the program. The evaluation draws a number of lessons from the PBS experience, including (i) There is no good way to end budget support in problematic contexts; (ii) The continuation of the PBS needs to be associated with a long-term program of enhanced capacity building and management of decentralization; (iii) Decentralization is a complex inter-action of programs and processes and successful approaches need to take a holistic view that clearly defines the objectives in terms of the accountabilities of the decentralized units and builds their capacity to meet those accountabilities; (iv) The decision to embed a health component channeled through the line ministry was questionable; (v) Where a project involves key issues of fiscal management at various levels of government there needs to be a steady long-term involvement in the project of a Public Sector Management specialist from the Bank's Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) network in addition to sector specialists; and (vi) The PBS presents an unusual case in which the Bank provides large scale financial support for expanded service delivery executed by sub-national governments.

the average during the previous four years (4.0 percent). Gold production and worker remittances
have been significant drivers of growth, but are subject to volatility and do not lend themselves to
sustained growth. Growth helped reduce poverty rates, from the recent peak of 38.0 percent in
2012 to 25.4 percent in 2015. Nevertheless, the country’s Human Development Index improved
slightly from 0.656 in 2013 (ranked 125nd among 187 countries) to 0.664 in 2015 (ranked 120th
among 188 countries). Inequality (the GINI Index) declined from 28.8 in 2013 to 26.8 in 2016,
Policy effectiveness has been undermined by high levels of corruption and frequent changes in
Government. Kyrgyz’s rank in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index

Argentina - Provincial Maternal-Child Health Sector Adjustment Loan Project; Argentina - Provincial Maternal-Child Health Sector Investment Project; and Brazil - Family Health Extension Adaptable Lending Project, Web Resource ,"This report contains a comparative assessment of the performance of three health operations in Argentina and Brazil.The three operations comprise a Sector Adjustment Loan (SECAL) in Argentina which supported the Government in the implementation of its health sector reform program; and two first-phases of multiple-years Adaptable Program Lending (APL1) in Brazil and Argentina. All three operations assisted the Governments in developing reforms at the level of Primary Health Care (PHC).The operations were prepared in the early 2000s, when Brazil was emerging from the 1999 economic crisis and the Argentina economy suffered one of its most severe crises in 2001-2002. 
The three operations aimed to improve the provision of basic care, health outcomes, utilization and quality of care; modify the incentive framework; and target better provision and quality of basic care to the poor and uninsured individuals.
IEG found that World Bank co-financing of an existing Government program enhances the probability for sustainability of the supported reforms.  Bank performance was highly satisfactory during preparation and supervision in both countries.Both borrowers showed strong leadership and ownership for the reforms. Implementation was slowed down in Brazil by national and local government elections and in Argentina by the delays caused by the Government in passing one policy action related to insurance risk distribution which was also a disbursement condition.", ,Content Type : Reports,"June 22, 2011

Turkey - Road Improvement and Traffic Safety Project, Web Resource ,"The Road Improvement and Traffic Safety Project for Turkey was selected for assessment due to the difference of opinion between the implementing agency and the Bank on project implementation issues and to review the impact of the traffic safety component. The report furthers the knowledge base on road safety programs, as well as governance and institutional issues in the transport sector. It agrees with the completion report in all ratings except that the outcome is judged to be moderately satisfactory instead of satisfactory. Three important lessons may be drawn from the project: A) Improvements in governance can best be achieved when there is a holistic program of institutional reform mandated at the highest levels of government, with interactive communication with operational staff to ensure that the changes take place in the field as envisioned. B) Traffic safety projects can be particularly successful where there is strong government commitment and support and where a participatory approach is pursued to ensure the support of all the diverse stakeholders. C) The elimination of road accident black spots can be a highly cost effective way to reduce both the accident rate and the degree of severity of the accidents occurring.", ,Content Type : Reports,"February 7, 2005

Bangladesh - Second Primary Education Development Project, Web Resource,"This Project Performance Assessment Report assesses the impact of the World Bank's contribution to the Second Primary Education Sector Program (PEDP II) in Bangladesh (2004 to 2011). PDEP II was one of the largest education Sector Wide Approach Projects (SWAPs) ever undertaken, consolidating externally-financed primary education projects into a joint operation. Under this approach, the government and ten development partners agreed to finance a common program and to harmonize procedures. The central objectives of the Program were (i) to raise coverage; and (ii) to improve education quality. The objectives were closely aligned with the government's strategy for education and remain highly relevant in the government's education strategy.The Program made a major contribution to strengthening sector-wide monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity, which at the start of the Program was quite low. The project's overall outcome was Satisfactory. Five key lessons can be distilled, (i) PEDP II represented the first successful SWAP for education in Bangladesh, bringing greater coherence to external support and reducing transactions costs for the government. To succeed, it required flexibility and adaptability from all sides. There appeared to be a concerted effort to move beyond institutional debates and to focus on implementation and technical issues. (ii) This sort of process requires trust and can only be gained from experience. Government ownership needs to be fostered. Development partners could be more subtle in understanding ownership and in identifying steps necessary to strengthen the understanding of new ideas and proposals. (iii) No sector is an island and it is important for sector programs to coordinate with efforts to strengthen public administration and governance. It may make sense for development partners to include public administration specialists or economists on their team to ensure that they can maintain a meaningful dialogue with the appropriate central ministries as well as with other development project and programs. (iv) A SWAP is an evolutionary process that requires flexibility and adaptation to succeed. Development partners need to be flexible in the design of a SWAP and not expect a fully developed institution at the start of the process. In the end, the government and partners agreed to be selective. (v) With support, governments can transform M&E systems from a pro forma system of collecting data to a powerful tool for monitoring and decision making. The Program showed that it is possible to develop a working M&E system that not only generates data but uses the data to guide policy and strengthen the understanding of the results chain. Moving forward, there is a need to look at impacts and to make adjustments in individual initiatives, including the primary education stipend program as well as continued research is needed on the best way to design and implement training programs for teachers.

Indonesia - Climate Change Development Policy Loan Project, Web Resource ,"Ratings for the Climate Change Development Policy Loan Project for Indonesia were as follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. The more general lesson that can be derived from the observation immediately above is the need to be fully aware of the incentives (or lack thereof) for policy action implementation among the various government agencies and levels of government involved in a DPL. In a country like Indonesia where subnational governments have considerable autonomy and often go against specific central government policies and regulations with which they disagree by failing to implement or enforce them, this is a potentially significant constraint on the effectiveness of DPLs that require concrete actions, such as those associated with improved forest management and governance or prohibiting the use of fire for land clearing purposes, on the ground. A second and more positive lesson emphasized by the ICR that also merits further elaboration is that ""policy based operations provide an important convening instrument."" DPLs, particularly programmatic ones, indeed have considerable potential value as a convening instrument, and this is especially the case when key Finance and/or Planning Ministries take the lead in this regard (although this strong commitment to the operation needs to continue throughout the anticipated implementation period). As in the present case, they can also play a key role in helping to better coordinate and/or harmonize support from different development partners around a set of common objectives and agreed policy actions.

Senegal - Country Assistance Strategy for the period FY07 - FY10, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the Fiscal Years (FY) 2007-2010 Senegal Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the CAS Progress Report (CASPR) of FY 2009, and assesses the CAS Completion Report (CASCR). The review covers the joint program of the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). 

The broad objective of the World Bank Group (WBG) strategy was to address the challenges facing the country by maximizing synergies with the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and the Bank's Africa Action Plan. The CAS objectives were supported by a governance filter which aimed to improve efficiency and transparency in the use of public resources, to increase the accountability of government, and to strengthen and modernize the judicial system and mechanisms for private sector governance. 

IEG rates the overall outcome of the CAS as moderately unsatisfactory, concurring with the CASCR rating.  Although some objectives were achieved, a majority of them were only partially achieved and some were not achieved. Under the governance filter, some improvement was achieved in the budget process and in the transparency of budget execution but the overall progress toward improving governance was weak.

IEG concurs with the lessons identified in the CASCR and underscores three key points:  i) strong commitments and follow-up actions by the Government are critical for a WBG-supported intervention to lead to broader development impact than the intervention itself: ii) there is a need for stronger synergy between budget support operations and other WBG instruments such as AAA, TA, and investment projects; and iii) a coordinated approach between IDA, IFC and MIGA, while relevant, needs significant effort at the working level to build synergies and mutually reinforcing support.",Country :  Senegal,Content Type : Reports,"January 16, 2013

Cameroon - Completion and learning review for country partnership framework for the period FY10 - FY14 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"Cameroon is a lower middle income, resource-rich country with large potential. Due to its location, the country is the gateway to the economies of Central Africa and plays a central role in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). The Bank's strategy was well aligned with country challenges and the government's own objectives, with the emphasis of the CAS program on governance, competitiveness, and public sector services. The program generally did address key challenges for the country, and was largely unchanged in the CAS Progress Report (CASPR), at which time the CAS period was extended to include FY14, but some indicators were dropped and others were weakened primarily in terms of time of delivery. The program aligned quite well to the twin goals, but the poverty dimension of the WBG program could have been even stronger, including the attention to inclusion – although with a poverty rate of 37.5 percent (2014) there is strong overlap between poverty and shared prosperity issues. The CAS program was reasonably well designed in light of country requirements and (significant) constraints, and proved to be quite stable with all nine objectives maintained in the CASPR. It addressed appropriate and important areas, and was designed for gradual and quite modest improvements. The CASPR addressed an important stepping-up of supervision and implementation support,and also a stronger focus on a few selected operations going forward. IEG draws three main lessons from this CLR: First, programs addressing governance need to provide a mix of interventions commensurate with the nature of the objectives, be structured realistically to conditions on the ground and Bank instruments. Second, indicators need to be designed keeping in mind the ability to monitor progress and to measure and assess end results. Third, Bank country program documents including CLRs need to pay clear attention where there are (as for Cameroon) significant indications of broader underlying fiduciary and governance issues. IEG also agrees with the following lessons from the CLR: Centralized approaches to strengthening governance need to be complemented with decentralized and sector-based approaches. The impact of investment lending is much higher when it is accompanied by sector policy and institutional reform which is possible only when government ownership is strong.",Country :  Cameroon,Content Type : Reports,"March 15, 2017

The project was managed and implemented efficiently overall; and the credit was fully disbursed. Implementation, however, was constrained by the lack of Government counterpart financing and weak capacity of public sector implementing agencies. Lessons learned include the following: The Bank can be instrumental in stimulating government commitment but that support is insufficient to consolidate and sustain the commitment. The relevance of the objective and the degree of civil society mobilization are critical to Government commitment. Stimulation and nurturing of broad-based national commitment requires continuous and multiple efforts. The health sector's role is pivotal in the achievement of HIV/AIDS and population objectives. The absence of baseline data undermines opportunities to track and fine-tune the performance and impact of efforts.

IBRD and IFC jointly implemented the CPS; this review covers the activities of the two institutions. The CPS aimed at providing selective, performance-based support under three pillars and nine program objectives in support of Argentina's strategic development goals, (1) Sustainable Growth with Equity; (2) Social Inclusion; and (3) Improved Governance. The CPS was implemented during a period of exceptional country issues affecting economic development. The International Monetary Fund's Article IV Consultations last took place in 2006, and the country has had limited access to external financing. IEG rates the overall outcome of WBG support as Moderately Satisfactory. Under Pillar 1, the condition of the national and provincial roads system was strengthened, with major improvements in road safety. IBRD also supported improvements in urban infrastructure and in rural access to electricity, and increased agricultural productivity in project areas. Under Pillar 2, the Bank supported progress for stronger social inclusion including through a universal child allowance, and health insurance for marginal group-including almost two million beneficiaries for maternal and child health insurance coverage-and the training of large numbers of marginalized workers. Under Pillar 3, there has been some improvement in governance at the provincial and national levels, although a number of the indicators under this pillar were partial (such as improvements in one province) or process-oriented (including one objective focusing on Bank projects). The CPS Completion Report (CPSCR) provides the following lessons with which IEG agrees, with some modifications, (a) The importance of focusing on results while having flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and government priorities. (b) It can be more efficient to integrate governance as a cross-cutting theme into the overall engagement. (c) It is important to ensure that the results frameworks are tied to the activities under implementation, although IEG would add that is important at the same time for the results frameworks not to lose sight of the broader objectives. (d) The dialogue with government counterparts can be strengthened by focusing on areas where there is mutual commitment. Here IEG would add as long as there is no shying away from important issues even if potentially contentious. (e) Maintaining a regular dialogue with government counterparts and sharing implementation experiences can help improve portfolio importance. In addition, IEG would add another lesson, (f) to ensure program consistency and enhance evaluative credibility, it would be better for planned IFC activities to be linked to appropriate indicators in the results frameworks.

Jamaica - Fiscal and Debt Sustainability Development Policy Project, Web Resource,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is part of a set of project performance assessments exploring g development outcomes in different country contexts that are faced with particular challenges during the recent global financial crisis, such as the small, middle-income states of the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Jamaica, and St Lucia. The objectives of the Jamaica Fiscal and Debt Sustainability Development Policy Project were to (i) enhance fiscal and debt sustainability; (ii) increase the efficiency of financial management and budget processes; and (iii) reduce distortions and enhance the efficiency of the tax system. This single-tranche development policy loan (DPL), operational from January 2009 through January 2010, was targeted to assisting government in addressing immediate issues of fiscal and debt sustainability. It also provided an opportunity to engage with government on Jamaica's medium-term development program. The outcome of the project is rated as moderately satisfactory. Three key lessons emerged, (i) it is essential for the Bank to work in close collaboration with the IMF and other development partners in DPL operations to ensure complementarities and increase the likelihood of success of the overall program; (ii) a single DPL can be a useful entry point to address an emergency, and to engage with a country where the Bank had no ongoing macroeconomic policy dialogue for an extended period. Notably, a country such as Jamaica that undergoes a systemic crisis needs a medium-term programmatic approach; (iii) the Bank is often called upon to make difficult choices in its policy based lending which can involve high-risk/high reward strategic issues. In this case, it was clear from the beginning that the program would be subject to high macroeconomic risks and the success was not guaranteed. The Bank proceeded to support government's reform program that was conceptually sound but the risk of failures was high due to the magnitude of the problem facing the country. Under such conditions, the Bank might alternatively focus its early efforts more on institutional strengthening such as through advisory services to build capacity and to participate with significant funding in a broader reform program supported by IMF and other IFIs. The subsequent program was part of such a broader package.

Against this background, the World Bank Group program underwent two distinct phases: until January 2011, the government broadly supported the Bank program; after that, government priorities changed and Bank engagement showed difficulties. IEG agrees with the lessons in the CLR, particularly on the need to respond flexibly in a high-risk political environment. IEG would add that following the Arab Spring the Bank Group had to try to establish itself as a trusted development partner with the new government and with a civil society that played a key role by mobilizing. The ISN and its areas of intervention were in this spirit. With the ISN, the Bank Group took a calculated risk that with the benefit of hindsight did not lead to the expected results. Embedding institutional development, capacity building, and governance more systematically in program interventions would have been warranted.

(ii) Attribution issues: The final outcomes in a results framework should be specific and attributable to the project. (iii) Simple project design: In the context of low institutional capacity, simple project design with fewer components may enhance the focus of a project and the likelihood of full implementation. (iv) Capacity building: In a limited capacity environment, a “learning-by-doing” approach can be effective in building government capacity.

El Salvador - Completion and learning review for the period FY2010-14 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"El Salvador's growth has lagged its peers in Central America for the past decade. The

background was difficult, with the first center-left government in El Salvador since the end of the
civil war in 1991 running the country, facing a fragmented opposition, and having to deal with
tensions within the ruling party. The main longer term challenges were to increase the growth rate,
as slow growth has constrained poverty reduction, increase domestic savings and investment, and
reduce violence which has imposed a high social and economic cost. At the start of the CPS the
country was suffering the consequences of the global economic crisis, to which the government
responded with an anti-crisis plan. The WBG program set objectives, and outcomes, consistent
with the scope of the government's crisis response program, and each strategic area of intervention

Second, leveraging World Bank funding at country program level requires a breakaway from supporting projects that can be funded by Government and re-directing Bank resources to niche activities that could be completed without counterpart funding and which could serve as an example for government to replicate",Country :  Congo Republic,Content Type : Reports,"October 19, 2012

Trinidad-Tobago - Water Sector Institutional Strengthening Project, Web Resource ,"The overall disappointing performance reflects mainly over-ambitious objectives for such a short implementation period and a government change at the outset which exposed incomplete commitment to the project strategy and which exacerbated design and preparation shortfalls. In particular the arrangements for private sector management and preparation for private operation of water services were not supported broadly enough such that were unresolved tensions for much of the project between the government, WASA's board, the Bank, and the private management company, and WASA remains a public sector utility. There have been some service improvements (a small increase in customers supplied, water production, improved metering and billing) but some serious shortfalls remain (reliability of supply, minimal sewerage treatment, over-manning, and financial viability).

Nepal - Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project, Web Resource ,"The ratings for the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project for Nepal are as follows: outcome was satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was significant; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned from the projects included: comprehensive approaches to development in which provision of small-scale infrastructure is accompanied by capacity-building to develop local institutions and ownership are more successful than infrastructure alone. When existing institutions fail and are unwilling to reform, careful design of new institutions can be a viable solution. The success of this approach is heavily conditioned on in-depth institutional analysis, close attention to the governance structure and the willingness of the Bank to stand firm against vested interests for as long as it takes to be accepted. Even so, government does have a role and its interest must be internalized in the governance and regulatory structures of new organizations: partnership is better than conflict. Small pilot projects to test new institutional approaches can be very successful providing they adopt a learning approach and give thoughtful attention to feedback from continuous monitoring to refine the development model. If improved health outcomes are a project objective then careful design of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to link project interventions to improvements in health incomes is needed.

The first project’s overall outcome was rated satisfactory; the project had demonstrated that demand-driven and community-managed schemes are likely to be more sustainable than supply-driven schemes that are led by the government without extensive community participation.

The development objectives of the second project, the subject of this PPAR, were to (i) improve the institutional performance of the rural water supply and sanitation sector and mainstream the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board (Fund Board) approach in the government’s system, and (ii) support communities to form inclusive local water supply and sanitation user groups that could plan, implement, and operate drinking water and sanitation infrastructure to deliver sustainable health, hygiene, and productivity benefits to rural households.

Project ratings were as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant, World Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Major lessons from the project include: (i) Mainstreaming a community-led approach in a supply-driven government structure is difficult to implement in the absence of a prior agreement with government and continuous advocacy. (ii) Project implementation arrangements that are not linked to institutions that have a legal mandate and parallel institutional structures undermine the sustainability of the project. (iii) Given that women are main stakeholders, placing them at the center of planning and implementation of a community-led rural water supply and sanitation project supports sustainable benefits. (iv) When project sustainability rests on community contribution to the operations and maintenance (O&M) costs, there is a need to prepare and agree on an explicit O&M plan with the community at the project’s development phase.

The JPS-2 was a joint strategy of the WBG and the African Development Bank (AfDB).The Gambia is a small, fragile and landlocked country with a GNI per capita income of USD 430 in 2016.The JPS-2 had eight objectives organized around two pillars or focus areas: (i) enhancing productive capacity and competitiveness; (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity for economic governance and public service delivery. The JPS-2 was aligned with the government's medium term development plan as articulated in its Program for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE) 2012-2016 and the government's long-term plan contained in Vision 2020.The JPS-2 focus areas and objectives were aligned with government's Medium Term Development Plan (PAGE), and its long-term strategy, Vision 2020. The joint strategy and clear division of labor with AfDB provided the foundation for WBG's selectivity. The WBG's program was generally selective in terms of focus areas, objectives and interventions. IEG concurs with some of the key lessons which are summarized as follows: (i) strong donor collaboration is critical but could also have high transactions costs; (ii) country capacity is an important consideration in data collection and quality, and in developing a results framework; and (iii) formal mid-course corrections through the PLR process is even more important in a difficult country circumstances. IEG adds the following lessons: i) Small and fragile countries could benefit from participation in regional integration operations by leveraging limited IDA financing and maximizing development impact. In the case of the Gambia, its participation in regional operations brought benefits to the country in terms of improved technology adoption in agriculture and increased connectivity. ii) To the extent possible, it is important that WBG interventions are aligned to the CPS objectives and their contributions reflected in the results framework.

Philippines - Philippines Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) : CAS Progress Report, Web Resource,"This review examines the implementation of the FY2010-FY2012 Philippines Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and the CAS Progress Report (CASPR) of FY2011. IBRD, IFC, and MIGA jointly implemented the CAS, and this review covers the joint program of the three institutions. IEG rates the outcome of WBG support as Moderately Satisfactory. The CAS sought to achieve inclusive growth through specific outcomes organized under 5 pillars and 11 objectives, (i) a stable macro economy; (ii) an improved investment climate; (iii) better public sector delivery; (iv) reduced vulnerabilities; and (v) good governance. The CASPR maintained the same pillars but made changes in response to changed priorities in 2010, including to the indicators and milestones of the results framework. Strong GDP growth, a declining ratio of public expenditures to GDP, and increased financial stability were achieved, and while tax revenue increased, set targets for taxpayer compliance were not achieved. Under the second pillar, there was a substantial increase in access to finance, particularly to small and medium enterprises, and the overall competitiveness rating for the Philippines improved; however, a few infrastructure projects underperformed. Progress was achieved in overall primary and secondary enrolment rates, although completion rates declined. While basic health measures on tuberculosis and infant mortality improved, immunization coverage and prenatal health deteriorated. In poor areas, higher primary and secondary school enrollment rates, and greater overall access to clean water and sanitation was achieved, but the number of poor municipalities covered by the community driven development program fell slightly short of target. The conditional cash transfer program is now operational; including improved stability and peace has been achieved in Mindanao. Results are mixed in climate change and disaster management. Lastly, under pillar (v) the country's governance ranking in the transparency international index has improved. Procurement performance has also improved overall, while achievements on better local governance are not verifiable. Of the several CASCR lessons, this assessment highlights three. (1) Progress on combating corruption, though slow, will benefit from stronger government commitment, and from champions who advocated for better governance in the different sectors where the Bank operates. (2) Progress in social protection in the Philippines is a good illustration of an area where Bank expertise based on international experience provides value added. (3) Selectivity is critical to avoid negligible engagement and likely weak outcomes, as illustrated by comparing the strong engagements in areas such as disaster response with other ones in which the Bank lacked purpose or continuity. For IFC, the Philippines represent a successful country engagement model. IFC was able to develop further its relationship with its key financial sector clients, by (i) offering a full set of IFC services of equity investments, loans, and advisory services; and (ii) addressing the client needs for technical assistance in the area of new product development and improvements in risk management.

Belize - Roads and Municipal Drainage Project, Web Resource ,"The overall outcome of the Roads and Municipal Drainage Project is moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome is rated high, and the performance of the Bank and the borrower is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The following lessons are derived from the project: (i) inadequate attention to local institutions and their governance arrangements may jeopardize achievement of urban development objectives. While it is tempting to think of infrastructure projects as being focused on engineering, the reality in Belize is that little of the infrastructure will be able to function because sound institutions and good governance are weak or absent; (ii) technical assistance in the form of strategies and plans for infrastructure investment may be ineffectual in the absence of government ownership and a defined medium-term fiscal framework within which to situate them. As this framework was missing in Belize the technical assistance was effectively wasted; (iii) simple engineering solutions can deliver substantial development impacts even when there are adverse institutional and political circumstances. In this project the Burrell Boom Bridge greatly enhanced the capacity of Belize's road infrastructure, particularly for disaster management following hurricanes; (iv) drainage and roads are component parts of town planning and cannot be planned independently or randomly. Although strong and well-coordinated planning institutions are prerequisites for planning infrastructure investment for urban areas these were not available in Belize; and (v) drainage systems cannot be designed piecemeal. They have to be designed within the context of a watershed, taking into account the future plans for that watershed in terms of land use, and be structured in such a way that they incrementally improve the drainage. The lack of comprehensive planning and poor sequencing of municipal drainage works in Belize demonstrated that an ad hoc approach will not work.",Country :  Belize,Content Type : Reports,"June 23, 2008

"Mozambique - Third, Fourth and Fifth Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project", Web Resource ,"Soon after Mozambique's independence from Portugal in 1975 a civil war started that lasted 15 years, caused considerable damage to infrastructure in rural areas, and decimated the national economy. A peace agreement in 1992 was followed in 1994 by the election of a representative Government, which turned its attention to maintaining peace and stability and to promoting private sector development through the removal of Government controls over economic activity. Following the formation of a stable democratic Government, Mozambique's economy, particularly the agricultural sector, started to grow rapidly. These policies and their results attracted many donors, including the World Bank, to support Mozambique's development during the 1990s.

Romania : development policy loan with a deferred drawdown option, Web Resource ,"This PPAR evaluates the Romania development policy loan with a deferred drawdown option (DPL-DDO). In the fragile postcrisis global economic context, the government requested the €1 billion loan to consolidate fiscal gains, build fiscal buffers, and accelerate structural reforms to boost a sustainable economic recovery. The loan was approved by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors in June 2012 and closed in October 2014 after full disbursement in two tranches: €700 million in mid-October 2013 and of €300 million at the end of June 2014. The objective of the DPL-DDO was to assist the government in meeting the fiscal sustainability goals defined by the European Union (EU) Fiscal Compact. The reform program aimed to (i) improve tax compliance, revenue collection and fiscal discipline, and reduce administrative costs; (ii) improve governance of energy state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and strengthen their fiscal sustainability; and (iii) improve fiscal sustainability of the health sector. An additional objective of the DPL-DDO, which was not explicitly stated as such in the program document or the loan agreement, was to help augment the government’s fiscal buffer as the undisbursed funds of the loan could count toward it.

Ratings for the Development Policy Loan with a Deferred Drawdown Option project are as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, World Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons from this project include: (i) The success of difficult institutional reforms in the energy sector underscored strong government commitment, which was strengthened by the liberalization roadmap agreed with the European Commission. (ii) More specifically, tax reforms are key to improving tax collection and reducing the compliance burden for taxpayers and businesses, but are potentially threatening to the status quo, which provides wide discretionary powers and rent-seeking opportunities.

Ratings for the Education Sector Strategic Program Project for Mozambique are as follows: outcome was moderately unsatisfactory; risk to the development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory; and Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned from the projects included: very low-income countries receiving donor aid may succeed in providing broad access to education. But without a critical number o f reasonably well educated teachers, interested administrators, and strong instructional supervision, the educational system may provide little learning to the students. Monitoring of learning outcomes is critical in all education projects, particularly where very poor populations are involved. Without clear and monitor able targets, educational systems may enroll and graduate students who lack basic skills. Governments are likely to respond to donor priorities and informational requirements. If donors are perceived as focusing mainly on access, governments are less likely to focus on improving learning outcomes. Strategies aimed at increasing girls' enrolment require strong government commitment at a high level to be effective. Otherwise, activities may take place but prove unsustainable or ineffective in the long run.",Country :  Mozambique,Content Type : Reports,"June 17, 2008

Guatemala - Enhanced Fiscal and Financial Management for Greater Opportunities DPL Series, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) evaluates a series of two development policy loans (DPLs) to Guatemala: Fiscal Space for Greater Opportunities ($200 million, P131763), and Enhanced Fiscal and Financial Management for Greater Opportunities ($340 million, P133738). The assessment aims to verify whether the operation achieved its intended outcomes, to understand what worked well and what did not, and to draw lessons for the future. The objectives of the series were to (i) strengthen tax administration and tax policy, (ii) strengthen budget management and increase the results orientation of public spending, and (iii) improve the management and coordination of social policies.

Ratings are as follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was high, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. This Project Performance Assessment Report offers the following lessons: (i) Tax administration and tax policy reforms in the face of major governance issues and long-standing opposition from influential interest groups are unlikely to be successful, even if backed by the World Bank’s analytical support, policy dialogue, and financing. Under these conditions, directly and indirectly targeting the governance issues over a longer period is necessary. (ii) Achieving progress on results budgeting requires strengthening of capacity, political commitment, sound monitoring and evaluation indicators, and cross-agency collaboration. (iii) Achieving results in policy lending requires a sound results framework, a credible theory of change, close linking of objectives with policy actions, and outcome-oriented target indicators.

Armenia - Energy Efficiency Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) evaluates the development effectiveness of the Energy Efficiency Project in Armenia. The project was selected for a PPAR to learn from an innovative pilot project that influenced the design and experience of other energy efficiency projects and interventions. Energy efficiency is of strategic importance for the World Bank given its role in supporting climate change mitigation, which is a major corporate priority. The project development objective was to reduce energy consumption of social and other public facilities in Armenia and decrease greenhouse gas emissions through the removal of barriers to the implementation of energy efficiency investments in the public sector. The project was financed through a Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant and government funds totaling $10.7 million. The project was implemented in 2012–16.

Ratings from the Energy Efficiency Project were as follows: Outcomes was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons from the project include: (i) Energy efficiency revolving funds can be market enablers by partnering with commercial and financial institutions, but there are few prospects for scale up and energy efficiency market transformation without the commitment of private businesses. (ii) Practical demonstration of the technical and financial feasibility of an innovative energy efficiency transaction program can only influence positive systemic change in the legal and regulatory framework if there is government commitment to the approach and long‐term funding. (iii) Appropriate legislation and regulation can provide incentives to undertake energy efficiency measures, but they are not sufficient without a strong government energy efficiency agency in place that is responsible for monitoring and enforcement. (iv) The design of a pilot project needs to go beyond demonstration effects and lay the foundation for sustainable operations over time.

Burundi - Country assistance strategy for the period FY09-12 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the Burundi Country assistance Strategy (CAS) of Fiscal Years (FY) 2009-2012 and the CAS Progress Report (CASPR) of FY 2011, and assesses the CAS Completion Report (CASCR). The review covers the joint program of the World Bank and IFC.  

The CAS aimed to support Burundi's transition from a post-conflict economy to a developing economy by selectively assisting the government to implement its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).  

The CASCR rates the overall outcome of the CAS program as moderately satisfactory. IEG is able to concur with the CASCR rating, although in its view the rating is borderline as the evidence of acceptable progress toward some outcomes is weak.

IEG concurs with the lessons outlined in the CASCR and underscores four additional points. First, in post-conflict countries with low capacity, particular caution is called for when setting broad objectives (e.g. governance) that require a broad-based set of actions to achieve them. Second, the results framework is intended to be a management tool. It needs to capture all of the major aspects of the CAS program and the links between WBG actions and CAS outcomes and strategic objectives. Third, the CASPR provides an opportunity for the country team to adjust the CAS program, including outcome targets, based on new information acquired during the initial phase of CAS implementation. Finally, IFC's experience suggests that when client capacity is low, IFC field presence is very important in order to ensure successful preparation and implementation of its program.",Country :  Burundi,Content Type : Reports,"October 15, 2012

The principle objective of the World Bank Group strategy was to help the Government achieve its objectives of accelerating and sharing growth. Supporting expenditure management and infrastructure investments were the two main focus areas of the CAS, while ""good governance"" and HIV measures would be mainstreamed into all operations.

IEG rates the overall outcome of IDA assistance as moderately unsatisfactory, below the CASCR rating of moderately satisfactory. Although IDA contributed to commendable achievement in certain areas, results achieved fell considerably short of expectations in others. On the cross-cutting themes, IDA's efforts at improving governance helped promote good governance and anticorruption practices in some areas, but were not able to produce the expected results; mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS got very little traction and consequently no results.

IEG concurs with the lessons identified in the CASCR but underscores two additional points: i) given the large role Trust Fund activities play in implementation of many of the CASs, IDA needs to systematically integrate them into the CAS results frameworks and report their status as part of the CASCRs; and ii) considering the large share of county budgets that go into Analytical and Advisory Assistance (AAA), World Bank needs to put in place mechanisms for systematic planning, management and self-evaluation of the AAA programs.",Country :  Zambia,Content Type : Reports,"March 14, 2013

Armenia - Completion and Learning Review for the Period FY14 - FY17 : IEG Review, Web Resource ,"Armenia is a lower middle-income country with a GNI per capita of $3,990 in 2017. It is a
small and landlocked economy with borders closed with Azerbaijan and Turkey as a result of the
unsettled Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. It faces significant trading costs while trade accounts for
75.7 percent of GDP (2016). As a result of the 2014/15 Russian crisis and the slump in metal
export prices through 2016, Armenia’s annual GDP growth declined from 4.3 percent during 2009-
13 to 3.6 percent during 2014-17, even though this growth reflects a sharp rebound to 7.5 percent
in 2017. Slower growth and increased unemployment slowed progress in poverty reduction.
Unemployment increased from 16.2 percent in 2013 to 18.3 percent in 2015, where it remained
through 2017. After declining from 35.8 percent in 2010 to 30.0 percent in 2014, the headcount
poverty ratio changed little through 2016. Income inequality (the Gini coefficient) also changed
little, from 31.5 in 2013 to 32.5 in 2016. During the CPS period, broader measures in social

previous CPS (FY09-13): (i) supporting competitiveness and job creation; (ii) improving efficiency
and targeting of social services; and (iii) improving governance and decreasing corruption. The
CPS was broadly aligned with the Government of Armenia (GoA) Development Strategy 2025

accelerated economic growth and job creation. World Bank Group’s support was also aligned with
a number of GoA’s strategies and programs, including in the areas of strengthening
competitiveness, enhancing social and environmental sustainability and improving the efficiency

Four priorities stood out: (i) pursue sound macroeconomic and structural fiscal policies to maintain stability and reduce vulnerabilities, (ii) improve the investment climate and labor market to increase competitiveness and create jobs, especially for women and youth, (iii) reform education, health service provision, and social welfare to increase productivity and promote equal opportunity, and (iv) continue reforms of energy and water sectors, and invest in increasing energy efficiency. In support of the government's objectives, the WBG Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) pursued reforms in three areas for enhancing competitiveness and employment, improving equity and public services, and deepening sustainable development. The CPS was extended by one year to include FY16, in part to allow the CPS period to be aligned with the political cycle, as parliamentary elections were scheduled for mid-2015.The CPS supported the government's priorities and was adjusted during the PLR to reflect changing priorities, although the adjustment was not robust enough to reflect economic vulnerabilities. The program areas were selective, but program objectives were unfocused owing to their many dimensions, which diminished the program's impact. Development policy operations and project lending were complemented by economic and sector work and technical assistance; however, the non-lending portfolio was spread thinly over many areas.In Focus Area 1, there was limited progress in increasing domestic savings and enhancing external resilience while progress was mixed on the investment and business climate objective. The objective on sustaining macroeconomic stability, domestic savings, strengthen exports and external resilience had multiple dimensions not reflected in the two outcome indicators that covered a narrow range of the objective. Corporate governance was improved through more extensive firm audits, and enhanced reporting and disclosure requirements. In Focus Area II performance was adequate, with some progress on gender equality and a more inclusive labor market, and evidence of improved equity in the provision of health services. While work remains to be done in health to improve client satisfaction, broad measures of health outcomes show progress in improving health outcomes during the program period. In Focus Area III, good progress was made in increasing the supply of energy and use of renewable energy, mixed progress on improving the sustainability of Turkish cities, and limited achievements in strengthening environmental management and adaptation to climate change.", ,Content Type : Reports,"August 3, 2017

Uruguay - Country partnership framework for the period FY11-15 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"Uruguay is one of the richest countries in Latin America, and the economic context for this
CPS was one of initially high growth, slowing down during the second half of the CPS period
primarily owing to weakening external conditions. Average growth was about 5 percent annually
during the period, but growth slowed significantly starting in 2012 and is projected at 1.6 percent in
2015 by the IMF. This slowdown was problematic because Uruguay's success in reducing poverty
was primarily a function of rapid job creation accompanied by significant growth in real wages.
The key challenge for the government during the CPS period was to continue reducing poverty in
a sustainable way, while enhancing competitiveness of the economy. The government defined its
longer term priorities in a five-year budget coinciding with the 2010-2015 mandate of the new
administration and with the CPS period. The priorities were to: 1) adhere to prudent fiscal policies,
2) strengthen competitiveness, 3) expand and improve social service delivery, especially

"Russian Federation - Coal Sector Adjustment Loan, and Second Coal Sector Adjustment Loan", Web Resource ,"TThere were some shortcomings in outcome and in Bank and Borrower performance, mainly related to inadequate attention under this project to the issues of divested social assets, environmental mitigation, safety and health that make up the unfinished reform agenda. Thus, the Evaluation Summary rating of satisfactory for outcome of both projects is confirmed, and the performance of both the Bank and the Borrower is rated satisfactory rather than highly satisfactory. The rating of sustainability as likely for both projects is also confirmed, and that for institutional development impact is raised from substantial to high. The experience of coal sector restructuring in Russia points to a few important lessons of general applicability in the case of complex and politically contentious reform programs with a high social impact: government commitment and political will are indispensable. External financing in support of coal restructuring in Russia provided a powerful incentive to stay the course, but the decisive factor in securing success was the fundamental commitment of the Government. Effective stakeholder participation can greatly enhance robustness of the achievements and lessen the implementation and information burdens of the Government and the Bank. A strengthened safety net helps greatly in gaining acceptance of enterprise closures among workers and their communities, even in difficult and polarized situations. Adequate attention and funding should be devoted up front to the environmental aspects of enterprise closures (especially in the case of mines) to minimize the problem of large residual liabilities that may hold up the liquidation of enterprises that have already ceased operations. Finally, implementation schedules should be realistic and flexible, while disbursements should be tailored to concrete progress in agreed reforms. The Coal SECAL II was under implementation for four years instead of the originally planned two years, with most of the progress recorded in the last two years. Moreover, the 1999 restructuring of the loan ' s original floating tranches into smaller, more manageable tranches was instrumental in facilitating implementation of the agreed restructuring actions.",Country :  Russian Federation,Content Type : Reports,"June 4, 2003

The Albania Durres Port Project had the following ratings: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was negligible to low; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned from this assessment included: in conditions where government capacity is weak the establishment of a separate project implementation unit (PIU) for each operation may be necessary in the short term, but ways must also be sought to strengthen government capacity so that regular departments can take over PIU responsibilities in the medium term, after which PIUs can be wound up; emergency credits can provide a quick response to a crisis situation, but should be kept as simple as possible if they are to be effective; long term sustainability of a road network depends on a reliable funding stream; organizational restructuring projects should not be planned in excessive detail up front, since it is very difficult to assess the degree of government commitment to reform and the time it will take to put the legislative and regulatory framework in place; effective supervision provides an opportunity to adapt the details as the project proceeds; the Port of Durres project shows the dangers of proceeding with civil works on the basis of poor cost estimates and preliminary design; the key lesson for the Bank in responding to an emergency unexpectedly arising during implementation is to ensure that all stakeholders are treated equally, and that a flexible attitude is taken so that the credit can be amended in response to changing circumstances.",Country :  Albania,Content Type : Reports,"June 26, 2007

Mozambique - Country Partnership Framework Completion and Learning Review for the Period FY12-FY15 : IEG Review, Web Resource ,"Mozambique is a low income country with a GNI per capita of $1,120 in 2014. The country experienced rapid growth over the last 25 years, but high poverty rates persist, particularly in the rural areas. Data from the National Statistics Institute show that the poverty headcount ratio fell from 70 to 46 percent between 1996 and 2014. The country’s reliance on capital intensive investments led to rapid economic growth but generated relatively few jobs and their ties to the rest of the economy are limited. Unemployment rate remained at 22.6 percent in 2012-2014. The country ranks low in Human Development Index: 180 out of 188 countries. Natural hazards hit the country frequently and hard, and are likely to worsen with climate change. The government’s Action Plan to Reduce Poverty for 2011-2014 (Plano de Acção de Redução de Pobreza -PARP) sought to confront these problems and the WBG’s Country partnership Strategy (CPS) addressed some of these challenges under the pillars of competitiveness and employment (Focus Area I), vulnerability and resilience (Focus Area II), and a foundation pillar, governance and public sector capacity (Focus Area III). In April 2016, the government acknowledged to the IMF that it had borrowed an amount in excess of $1 billion in commercial terms during 2012-2015. The disclosure weakened investors’ confidence in the country’s macroeconomic stability, and contributed to further depreciating the metical.

Although peace had finally taken root and the country had been experiencing economic growth, political tensions remained very high and decision-making was frequently frustrated by BH's decentralized and highly complex political and institutional structure. Further progress was critically dependent on: (i) addressing governance and institutional weaknesses to improve government functioning and create a single, coherent economic space; (ii) increasing competitiveness to enable continued export growth in the face of post-crisis volatility in the EU (the main destination for BH exports) and increased competition from Balkan neighbors; (iii) rationalizing a costly and inefficient system of social benefits; and (iv) exploiting the rich natural resource base in a more sustainable manner.

At the time, improving education quality, efficiency, equity and sector management were priorities for the State Government of Pernambuco. Challenges at the time of project preparation were the flow of students and the quality of education in fundamental and secondary education, as Pernambuco’s Basic Education Development Index (IDEB) for fundamental and secondary education scores were lower than the Brazil’s overall score according to the Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira (INEP).

Bosnia and Herzegovina - Business Environment Adjustment Credit Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews the Bosnia and Herzegovina Business Enabling Environment Structural Adjustment Credit (BAC), implemented from 2002 to 2007. This assessment will inform the forthcoming evaluation ""Investment Climate Reforms: An Independent Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Reforms of Business Regulations."" The operation was to support government's reform program, improve the investment climate, create an enabling environment to promote domestic and foreign investment, and to support private sector growth. The BAC was designed as a two-tranche sector adjustment credit that was accompanied by a series of parallel donor capacity-building technical assistance activities. The tranched design proved difficult to implement in practice because the capacity-building conditions could not be fulfilled within the target dates. In addition, the BAC was initiated prior to the Bank's operational policy on Development Policy Lending (DPL) that set out a new approach regarding budget support financing. The DPL approach would have specified incorporating a results measurement framework. The BAC was facing the unique challenges of (i) post-conflict recovery and reconstruction after civil war, which ended with the Dayton Accords of 1995 and two governing entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and the Republika Srpska (RS); (ii) transformation from a centrally planned to a market economy; and (iii) a highly complex governance structure designed primarily to restore peace. Progress had been made on the rehabilitation of infrastructure and basic institutional development, including the establishment of the central bank, state and entity treasuries, and issuance of the national currency. On balance, the BAC's overall outcome is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The legacy of this operation is unique and not easily susceptible to generalized lessons. Bearing this in mind, the key lessons are (i) In high risk environments, an ""early win"" strategy may be required but should be accompanied by flexibility, structured reviews, and an exit strategy in the event that reforms come off track. (ii) Formulation of laws in adjustment operations needs to be accompanied by careful attention to addressing implementation constraints, particularly in post-crisis or transition environments. (iii) The choice of a quick disbursing instrument was questionable in light of the medium-term requirements of capacity-building. Operations that require intensive on-the-ground capacity assistance are not suitable for pure adjustment-type lending, because the adjustment timetable is usually inconsistent with the capacity-building timetable. Capacity-building projects must be of long duration, especially in a post-conflict situation, to adjust to local conditions and allow sufficient implementation time to build up sustainability. Programmatic lending instruments would be more consistent with these requirements. (iv) In situations with multiple development partners and significant capacity constraints, effective leadership and coordination, both in government and development partners, is essential.

Romania - Country partnership strategy completion report (CPSCR) review for the period FY2009-13 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the FY2009-FY2013 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), and the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) of FY2012. The CPS was jointly implemented by IBRD and IFC, and this review covers the joint program of the two institutions. This CPS was prepared under the initial adverse effects of the global financial crisis on Romania in 2009, and following a period where the country virtually disengaged from the Bank and concentrated on European Union-related issues. The Bank re-engagement in the CPS was part of a joint crisis response by the IMF, the European Commission (EC), and the World Bank Group (WBG). The program was quite successful during the first half of the CPS period, under immediate pressure from the dry up of capital inflows. The government concentrated its efforts on stabilizing the economy, which had shifted from strong growth into a serious recession. With World Bank support, the government secured fiscal savings to achieve fiscal targets without adversely affecting priority services and social assistance, and started to modernize the public administration. Short term measures were also effective in financial sector strengthening, where the Bank worked closely with the IMF. Yet, at the CPSPR stage as the pressures from the global crisis eased, the pace of reforms seems to have declined in some areas. This was the time when the program also shifted to addressing more difficult longer term policy reforms. It then became apparent that progress in governance and judicial reforms would be slower than envisaged in the CPS, as would be the case in transport, energy, and agriculture. Projects in the latter three areas were ongoing at the time of the CPS and had started with substantial government support, but government ownership declined after project approval. The momentum for policy reform increased with the financial crisis, but in general, government support in these areas has been inadequate and inconsistent, in part due to tight financing constraints after 2009. In addition, reforms to make the pension system sustainable moved in the right direction but much more gradually than envisaged in the CPS, and Roma inclusion did not have the political backing to progress as envisaged by both the Bank and the EC. IEG rates the overall outcome of WBG support as Moderately Satisfactory. IEG agrees with the CPSCR conclusions on partnership, programmatic development policy loans, the usefulness of reimbursable advisory services, and inclusive consultation. The experience of the Bank in Romania shows that, (a) partnerships can be powerful to get reforms done when government ownership is lukewarm; (b) programmatic development policy loans as crisis response is an effective instrument to sequence reform according to priority and build on achievements in a crisis situation, but can lose effectiveness as soon as the crisis is over and the incentive for reform declines; and (c) demand-driven advisory services can be an effective tool in a middle-income country that has a fairly clear policy path and shortage of local skills in the areas of diagnostics and policy design.

While land titling was the more successful component, the project fell short of expectations. Its outcome is rated unsatisfactory. Three main lessons can be drawn, (i) policy and institutional reform are essential when legal land administration frameworks are complex, and where land rights are both ill-defined and not administered transparently. A project that pays greater attention to land titling than to reform is unlikely to lead to a sustained increase in tenure security; (ii) gains of a systematic land titling program are less likely to be sustained if the cost of registering land transactions is high. Moreover, land tenure security entails appropriate upholding and enforcement of land rights; and (iii) adequate coordination between the sub-provincial agencies responsible for surveying, mapping and zoning, is a prerequisite for decentralization of land management, as is consistent adequate funding at sub-national levels.", ,Content Type : Reports,"March 5, 2014

Belarus - Completion and learning review for the period FY18-FY22 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review of the World Bank Group's Completion and Learning Report (CLR) covers the period of the original Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), FY14-17, and the Performance and Learning Review (PLR) discussed at the Board on June 30, 2016.Belarus is an upper middle-income country.During 2014-16 the economy contracted at an average annual rate of -1.6 percent, compared with an average growth of 1.8 percent for the ECA region.The CPS corresponded well with the government's stated development objectives and was aligned with the government's Program of Social and Economic Development for 2011-2015 which has since been followed by a 2016-2020 Development Program and Action Plan. The CPS program had three pillars: (i) improving competitiveness of the economy by supporting structural reforms, including reducing the role of the state, transforming state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector, promoting private and financial sector development and integration into the global economy; (ii) improved efficiency and quality of public infrastructure services, enhanced and sustainable use of agricultural and forestry services, and increased public goods benefits; and (iii) improved human development outcomes through better delivery of education, health and social services.",Country :  Belarus,Content Type : Reports,"March 22, 2018

Mexico - Rural Finance Development Structural Adjustment Project, Web Resource ,"The Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses the Mexico Rural Finance Development Structural Adjustment Loan that was approved in May 2003 and closed in December 2005. This review informs a broader assessment of Bank operations assisting in the provision of financial services to underserved sectors--primarily microenterprises--but also, as in this case, rural enterprises. This report, therefore, includes some considerations and assessments that are normally not part of a PPAR; specifically, it evaluates project performance after the end of  the Bank's involvement, and uses evaluation criteria within a broader, more global perspective than those normally used. The objectives of the Mexico rural finance operation were (i) to support the liquidation of ""Banrural,"" a financial institution that for several decades had provided subsidized credit for agriculture, accumulated very large losses caused by extreme inefficiencies, low collection efforts, and excessive administrative costs; and (ii) to assist government to put in its place ""Financiera Rural,"" which would not receive deposits or issue any debt, but was to be totally financed with an endowment created by the government; furthermore, the new agency would maintain the value of its capital endowment in real terms, report periodically to the Mexican Congress, lend only to low- and middle-income rural producers, and move--over time--fully to second-tier lending. 
The outcome of the operation is rated highly satisfactory. The assessment draws four lessons:  (1) High quality analytical work as well as strong borrower commitment is essential for the success of an adjustment operation involving policy and institutional reforms. Part of the project's success is attributable to long-standing analytical work done by the Bank on Mexico's financial sector, including rural finance. Also, the 2001 Financial Sector Assessment program (FSAP), carried out jointly by the Bank and the IMF, had a decisive impact on the government's approach to the development bank reform in Mexico and the selection of the business model for ""Financiera Rural."" (2) The agency's development model is a good option for transforming a state-owned financial institution in instances when full privatization is not feasible and there is a need to expand credit to underserved groups in a cost-efficient manner. Many countries face the need to find a permanent solution to the inefficiency and recurrent losses caused by development banks, which require frequent and costly recapitalizations by governments. The creation of development banks without a social mandate is not a solution because such agencies would not be much different from a commercial bank. ""Financiera Rural"" presents a better solution because it transforms these banks into finance-oriented development agencies. The development agency promotes financial access for underserved sectors and market development through market-friendly instruments that do not distort market prices, nor discourage private sector activities, such as matching grants and subsidies financed by the government's budget. Its lending tends to be second-tier and is funded out of initial capital endowment or targeted budgetary appropriations, and not from deposits or other liabilities. (3) The strength of institutions depends on the quality of management and the adoption of appropriate procedures and practices. In the case of ""Financiera Rural,"" the project showed that institutions, their business plans and management do matter, and that the effort spent on defining a Strategic Plan, establishing the appropriate procedures and practices, and in building up a management information system, was worthwhile. Moreover, flexibility in institutional management is crucial to make changes in procedures and practices in response to changing circumstances and objectives. (4) Keeping the operation simple and concentrated on easily verifiable actions contributes to the success of adjustment operations. The sharp focus of this operation on institution-building and financial discipline for ""Financiera Rural"" proved to be one of the operation's best aspects and contributed to the positive project outcome.",Country :  Mexico,Content Type : Reports,"January 29, 2014

India - Completion and Learning Review for the Period FY13 - FY17 : IEG Review, Web Resource ,"This review of the India Completion and Learning Report of the World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covers the CPS period, FY13-FY17, including the CPS Performance and Learning Review (PLR) of September 2, 2015.The overarching goals of the WBG's CPS for India were to help the country accelerate poverty reduction and increase shared prosperity. The CPS was aligned with the government's Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012-2017), which sought high levels of economic growth and prioritized inclusiveness from several perspectives—poverty reduction, group equality, regional balance, and empowerment. The CPS organized its program around three engagement areas (or focus areas): (i) Integration with focus on physical connectivity to improve India's domestic, regional and global integration; (ii) Transformation by facilitating spatial transformation from rural to urban areas and benefitting from agglomeration economies, raising agricultural productivity and encouraging off-farm employment; and (iii) Inclusion by enhancing services in health, nutrition, education and social programs for the disadvantaged groups. The CPS had three cross-cutting themes of governance, environmental sustainability and gender equality which were envisaged to be embedded across the three engagement areas. The CPS committed to allocate 60 percent of the new commitments during the CPS directly to the states, of which half (30 percent) would go to the Low-Income States (LIS) and Special Category States (SCS).The government elected in May 2014 emphasized reforms to promote growth while maintaining attention to inclusion. The government and the WBG agreed to a narrow set of eight priorities to guide the work forward. These eight priorities could have provided the opportunity to consolidate the program interventions and sharpen the results framework. At the PLR, however, the CPS original program objectives remained virtually unchanged. The WBG responded to the new priorities by scaling up its lending and ASA; in effect, broadening the scope of its engagement in India beyond the original design. IEG concurs with key CLR lessons summarized as follows: i) expanding engagement in LIS/SCS requires significant time and resources; (ii) WBG activities in states were characterized by individual sector operations with limited integration, making the sum of engagement less than the parts; (iii) national-level operations supporting GoI Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were generally effective for scaling up impact and engaging on policy but often had implementation challenges; (iv) the World Bank's ability to support systemic improvements through operations depended on the long-term partnership in the sector more than the amount of financing; (v) an increase in operations with Results Based Frameworks (RBF) during the CPS period appeared to promise stronger impact, but these operations need to ensure that the M&E systems to trigger disbursements are thoroughly developed; and (vi) examples of cross-sectoral operations providing a more holistic approach need to be expanded further.",Country :  India,Content Type : Reports,"September 5, 2018

Pakistan - Country partnership strategy completion report (CPSCR) review for the period FY2010-14 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the FY10-FY13 Pakistan Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and of the FY2012-FY2014 CPS Progress Report (CPSPR). The CPS was jointly implemented by IBRD, IDA, and IFC and covers the joint program of the three institutions.

The CPS aimed to improve economic growth, conflict management, and social indicators with interventions organized under four pillars in the results matrix: (i) improving economic governance; (ii) improving human development and social protection; (iii) improving infrastructure to support growth; and (iv) improving security and reducing the risk of conflict. While the CPSPR maintained the same four pillars, it revisited a number of milestones and CPS outcomes, in response to changes in progress in the different areas, as well as to new situations that had emerged by the time of the CPS Progress Report. These new circumstances included the July 2010 and August 2011 floods, slower reforms and security issues, the issuance of the 2011 Framework for Economic Growth, and the 2010 18th Constitutional Amendment that devolved most government services and a share of revenues to the Provinces. The CPS identified three specific top-priority or ""transformational"" activities, (i) assisting the government to raise the ratio of tax revenue  to GDP through strengthened tax policy and administration; (ii) supporting power sector reform so as to ensure a sustainable expansion of power supply; and (iii) addressing security issues related both to coping with the consequences of conflict, and reducing the risk of future conflict.

IEG rates the outcome of WBG support as moderately unsatisfactory, consistent with the CPSCR rating. IEG rated two of the four pillars as moderately unsatisfactory, one as unsatisfactory and one as moderately satisfactory. 

IEG rated Pillar I on improving economic governance as unsatisfactory, with three outcomes partially achieved, and two not achieved; Pillar II on improving human development and social protection as moderately satisfactory, with one  outcome achieved, one mostly achieved, and two partially achieved;  Pillar III on improving infrastructure as moderately unsatisfactory, with one outcome mostly achieved, three outcomes partially achieved and one not achieved; and Pillar IV as moderately unsatisfactory, with two partially achieved outcomes. Outcomes achieved or mostly achieved were in the areas of safety nets; rural livelihoods; and urban services. Outcomes partially achieved related to  public expenditure; public sector management; governance of markets; access to education, health, nutrition and population services; transport and logistics; irrigation and agriculture; environmental sustainability; employment and livelihood opportunities in conflict affected areas, and responsiveness and effectiveness of the state in conflict areas.  Other outcomes were not achieved.

Of the several CPSCR lessons, this assessment highlights three: (i) the contribution of donor coordination to unifying messages on long-term issues (e.g., energy); (ii) the increased focus of sectors and instruments on CPS goals that can be achieved under a simpler results framework that is more actively monitored and used for program adjustments; and (iii) the pay-off that persistent engagement on key activities, even during difficult times, can have on results. To these, this assessment adds that the Bank is likely to improve results if it analyzes more systematically political economy considerations to improve the likelihood of a more implementable program of assistance.",Country :  Pakistan,Content Type : Reports,"April 21, 2014

Lesotho - Completion and learning review for the period FY10- FY14 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"Lesotho is a small, mostly mountainous and landlocked country with a largely rural population
of over 2 million in 2014. It is a lower middle country with a GNI per capita of $1,330 in 2014. Lesotho
has a highly open economy, and relies heavily on revenues from the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU) to finance large government expenditures. The economy grew at an annual average of 4.5
percent from 2010-2014 led by mining and construction sectors. Economic growth in the past decade,
however did not translate to reduction in poverty rates. Poverty in Lesotho is highly concentrated in
isolated rural areas where 80 percent of the population resides. Inequality as measured by the Gini
index of 54 is high with respect to comparable countries in the lower middle income category. Despite
high government expenditures on social services, the social indicators in health and education
remained unchanged. Lesotho's ranking of 161 (of the 173) in the Human Development Index (HDI)
places the country at the low end of the HDI. Lesotho's wage bill of 21 percent of GDP in 2014 is the
highest in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and with the expected fall of SACU revenues, the need for fiscal
adjustment and more efficient use of public services are even more critical. Lesotho's Country and
Policy Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating dropped to 3.4 in 2011 and 3.3 in 2014, from 3.5 since

Mexico - support to the social protection system in health project, Web Resource ,"This is the Project Performance Assessment Report for the Mexico Social Protection in Health Project (P116226). The project, approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on March 25, 2010, provided an International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan of $1,250 million (IBRD-78600), which represents the second largest World Bank operation by commitments of the entire World Bank human development cluster. The Government of Mexico provided counterpart financing of $26 billion equivalent. The loan became effective on December 29, 2010, and closed after three years on December 31, 2013. This report serves an accountability purpose by evaluating the extent to which the operation achieved its intended outcomes, but also a learning purpose. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) Review identified the project for evaluation to verify the project’s ratings following IEG’s revision of the outcome rating from satisfactory in the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) to moderately satisfactory in the ICR Review. In addition, this report aims to identify lessons for similar health insurance schemes and relevant World Bank–supported operations.

Ratings for the Support to the Social Protection System in Health Project is as follows: Outcome is moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome is moderate, World Bank performance is moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance is satisfactory. Lessons from the project include: (i) In times of economic crisis, if the country has a well-designed health program in place, the World Bank’s financial support can be effective in helping the government to sustain and expand access to health services, protecting the poor from the adverse impact of the crisis. (ii) Investment Project Financing can be an efficient alternative to development policy financing if there is government ownership of the national program and a strong monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system to monitor results. (iii) It may not be possible to achieve universal health coverage in fragmented health systems without an individual mandate for health insurance coverage. (iv) In decentralized health systems, to achieve the desired changes at the local level the use of incentives (compatibility) should be preferred to the use of regulations and aligned with the institutional capabilities of the agents.

Bangladesh - Female Secondary School Assistance Project, Web Resource ,"Project outcome is rated moderately satisfactory because main objectives were only partly achieved. Institutional development is rated modest. Sustainability is rated likely, because commitment to increasing enrollment and gender equity remains strong in Bangladesh. Borrower performance is rated satisfactory because, despite problems, the government made a great effort and implemented the project. Bank performance is also rated satisfactory, particularly because of the project ' s innovative design. Experience with the project confirms a number of OED lessons from education projects: 1) The very poor may enroll children to school in response to food or money. However, parents may do the minimum necessary to get the desired benefit and not necessarily encourage children ' s attendance. Incentives must be tied to attendance, study, and passing of examinations. 2) Enrollment in school, although important, does not automatically bring about education and information acquisition. Access to education of l o w quality has dubious benefits. Given systemic difficulties, governments and donors must provide the very poor with the means to help them attend classes regularly and learn the required material. 3) People may modify social customs for earnings and status, particularly if these customs have drawbacks. Award of stipends or possibly even simple cash transfers to families may be useful in postponing marriages for girls who did not attend or finish primary school, perhaps in the form of stipends for vocational training. 4) Significant amounts of overstated data in a database may make it hard to assess project effects. Decisions based on incorrect data may not help intended beneficiaries. Projects should aim at establishing realistic parameters and criteria for inclusion in various programs in order to have greater data accuracy. 5) 0 Programs that have much social appeal may receive political support and be more sustainable. Thus, political support is important. However, popular projects may also be harder to modify if governments perceive that their political benefits will be reduced; thus, criterion-based provisions for reviews should be established early on.",Country :  Bangladesh,Content Type : Reports,"June 20, 2003

The CPS was jointly implemented by IBRD/IDA, IFC, and MIGA; this review covers the joint program of the three institutions. The objective of the CPS was to support faster, more inclusive and greener growth while helping to prepare FYR Macedonia for EU accession. This objective would be achieved through three pillars, also referred to as priorities, (1) Faster Growth - competitiveness, including continued macroeconomic stability; (2) More Inclusive Growth - employability and social protection; and (3) Greener Growth - environmental sustainability and climate action. However, at the time of the CPSPR it was clear that in particular the crisis of the Eurozone was having a greater and more prolonged impact than expected on the country's economy, and that the main purpose of the program was to help the government respond to the crises, and thus to maintain macroeconomic stability, even though the stated objectives were not modified, and there were no corresponding modifications to the indicators in the results matrix. The CPSCR presents a number of lessons with which IEG agrees, including the importance of (i) close alignment with the government objectives, and those of key partners; (ii) government commitment and flexibility; (iii) a high-level policy dialogue; (iv) of a strategic focus on inclusion and sharing the fruits of economic growth; and (v) strong intra-WBG coordination for projects in the renewable energy sector. IEG finds three important additional lessons, the importance of (a) WBG flexibility and responsiveness when countries are faced with extraneous challenges; (b) Having appropriate and clearly focused results frameworks linked to key overall objectives; and (c) Adjusting such frameworks when warranted, in particular at the time of any Progress Report.

Key lessons convey that prospects for privatization of transport services (even in difficult economic times) may succeed in rail, road maintenance, and air transport service instances, due to their high potential to operate commercially; however, urban transport, particularly if under highly subsidized services, would be especially difficult to privatize. Furthermore, the human and financial resources constraints faced by low-income countries in establishing regulatory agencies may prove difficult; but Burkina ' s policy of retaining minority ownership, may prove a suitable substitute, if any temporarily. Once the privatization process is launched, the government and co-financiers should work in parallel to plan, and assist in the restructuring of central government agencies, a role likely to change for agencies after privatization; thus, the Bank should seek financing in a flexible way, in order to reallocate funding as needed toward technical assistance.

IEG concurs with the lessons summarized in the CPSCR. A cross-cutting theme is the complexity in designing and implementing a coherent and results-focused strategy in an environment that is not conducive to budget support, that makes it difficult to engage in high-level policy dialogue, that involves a large number of donors, that is characterized by limited client capacity, that is vulnerable to various shocks, and that has poor data for monitoring and evaluation. IEG also endorses the pragmatic approach recommended in the CPSCR (e.g., an expanded role for Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) support, consolidation of the portfolio around a few key areas where dialogue and coordination may be feasible and effective), and underscores the value of tracking evaluation on progress toward extending the technical-level partnerships that have been developed to policy-level partnerships.",Country :  Nicaragua,Content Type : Reports,"November 2, 2012

Bolivia - reducing maternal and infant mortality : a multi-project evaluation of 16 years of World Bank support to the health sector, Web Resource ,"Bolivia’s poor maternal and child health outcomes were of great concern in the 1990s. Infant and child mortality rates were 67 and 92 per 1,000 live births in 1998, and maternal mortality was 390 per 100,000 live births, risking Bolivia’s achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The capacities of the Bolivian health system were insufficient to respond to the need for health care access, availability, affordability, quality, and equity. Health facilities lacked essential drugs and equipment needed to provide good care. In addition to scarce and inefficiently distributed health workers, heath staff were often poorly trained, compromising the quality of treatment. The Expanded Immunization program had too little funding, poor communication strategies, and unreliable data, which led to declining immunization rates starting in 1996. Cultural and economic barriers limited demand for both preventive and curative care. The World Bank supported the government’s health sector reforms through a series of Adaptable Program Loans (APLs) over 16 years, including the 1999 Health Sector Reform Project, 2001 Second Phase of the Health Sector Reform Program, and 2008 Expanding Access to Reduce Health Inequities. The reforms supported by these projects are the subject of this Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR).

This report spans three projects. Ratings for the first project, Health Sector Reform (APL 1) is as follows: Outcome is satisfactory, risk to development outcome is moderate, Bank and Borrower performance is both moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the second project, Sector Phase of the Health Sector Reform Program (APL II) is as follows: Outcome is moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome is moderate, Bank and Borrower performance is both moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the third project, Expanding Access to Reduce Health Inequities (APL III) is as follows: Outcome is moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome is moderate, Bank and Borrower performance is both moderately satisfactory. Lessons from these projects include: (i) The definition of a common results framework is useful to align the efforts of different government levels. (ii) A robust results-based approach needs to define a clear mechanism of rewards/sanctions to function well. Otherwise it risks turning into a mere monitoring tool that could lead to perverse incentives. (iii) Project design coordinating efforts with parallel programs that have similar goals has a great potential for efficiency, but it raises methodological concerns about the attribution of outcomes. (iv) While continued focus on quality objectives is certainly commendable, it needs to be accompanied by more robust outcome measures to prove quality enhancements. (v) Programmatic approaches are suitable where sector knowledge is strong, program objectives are long-term and clear, and country ownership is established. (vi) Ambitious projects partially relying on a government promise to pass a reform law are likely to need a restructuring.

Nigeria - Community Based Poverty Reduction Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews the Community Based Poverty Reduction Project (CPRP) in Nigeria (2000 to 2009). Although the Nigerian economy is growing, the proportion of the population living in poverty is increasing every year, and poverty reduction remains a major challenge in both urban and--especially--rural areas. The most recent social indicators show signs of progress in some areas--especially the under-five and maternal mortality rates--and delays in others, such as access to safe water and sanitation. The objectives of the CPRP were (i) to improve access of the poor to social and economic infrastructure; and (ii) to increase the availability and management of development resources at the community level. The project was implemented in eight Nigerian States of which two had joined in 2005. The project's underlying principle was to involve communities in the design and implementation of poverty reduction programs. The bulk of the project, therefore, supported community-based initiatives in building and restructuring basic social and economic infrastructure. The project's overall outcome is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. Several lessons can be drawn, (i) Community-based initiatives need to be integrated and coordinated with government's broader poverty reduction strategy in order to effectively tackle poverty reduction. The CPRP was overall successful in increasing access of poor rural communities to water, education, and other social and economic infrastructure. However, to achieve profound and lasting impacts on poverty reduction, key elements include greater collaboration and partnership of communities with local government authorities, as well as active support of by relevant sectoral ministries. (ii) For micro-projects to be sustainable in the long run, the community-based development approach needs to engender and nurture a strong relationship between local communities and government at all levels. The collaboration between communities and local government is crucial also for functional reasons; namely, (a) to guarantee financial sustainability; and (b) to ensure the integration of the community-built infrastructure with the (larger) state and government infrastructure. (iii) Development project--including community-development projects--need to be coherent and complementary. This complementarity can originate within the project itself through harmonization across different projects, or coordination between the Community-Development-Driven (CDD) approach and the government provision. This latter approach would also produce institutional strengthening as an additional benefit. (iv) The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework is especially crucial for community-based development projects. The CPRP is an example of a project that was likely more successful than the M&E data can possibly tell. Key indicators were regularly collected and used by state agencies to carry out desk and field assessments of proposals, as well as the selection and funding of micro-projects, and to monitor the realization of the community infrastructure. However, very little was collected on targeting, the participatory process, and impacts on the well-being of the communities. This lack of information, besides preventing a full evaluation of the achievements of the project, also limits a deep understanding of the mechanisms that may enhance or weaken the CDD approach. (v) Community-development projects, when properly designed, have the potential of addressing the needs of community members who are traditionally marginalized or not adequately represented. There is limited evidence that women's needs were properly represented in the selection of the CPRP micro-projects. A constant effort was made to ensure that women were included in community decision-making and women's associations were encouraged to present proposals of their own. Moreover, the type of projects allowed for funding by the CPRP was especially pro-poor and generally managed in an inclusive way.

Their sustainability is likely, and institutional development impact is substantial. Bank and Borrower performances were also satisfactory. This assessment confirms a number of lessons: 1) It is possible to target successfully poor areas for interventions aimed at increasing enrollments, even in times of financial crises. Scholarships administered to the poor and disbursed to them promptly may be effective in sustaining enrollments and preventing dropout. 2) Community involvement may be a cost-effective and reliable means to build and support schools. Nevertheless, school committee members may not be able or willing to keep school expenditures low, may not have much time-to spend on school affairs, and may be unable to advise the principal effectively on educational matters. 3) Decentralization promotes effective use of resources. However, a central government may find it necessary to meet the basic educational needs of the poorest communities directly if national goals for basic education are to be achieved. 4) International comparative assessments of student achievement may provide critical feedback to governments interested in increasing the competitiveness of their human capital.

Kenya - Micro and Small Enterprise Training and Technology Project, Web Resource ,"The project outcome for the Kenya Micro and Small Enterprise Training and Technology Project is moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability is unlikely; institutional development impact is modest; Bank performance is unsatisfactory; and Borrower performance is unsatisfactory. Important lessons include: 1) Understand markets and institutions before designing the intervention. The nature o f market failures (if any) should guide the decision whether to intervene at all, and if so, whether to intervene on the supply side or the demand side o f the market. Implementation can be problematic because o f institutional and governance issues. Market and institutional assessments should be done prior to project design to identify these issues. 2) Choose the least-cost intervention. It is important not to over-subsidize services, both to avoid distorting markets and to limit the incentive for corruption. Vouchers may be a relatively high-cost way o f stimulating demand for business development services compared to alternative methods. And subsidies should not become the centerpiece of the project. 3) Favor private sector management. Current best practice in projects that use matching grants or vouchers to stimulate markets for business development services is to contract a private firm to manage the program. Clear incentives and performance indicators should be established. 4) Allow time to learn from the pilot phase, providing sufficient opportunity to get management and governance issues right.",Country :  Kenya,Content Type : Reports,"June 24, 2005

Paraguay - Completion and Learning Review for the Period FY15-FY18 : IEG Review, Web Resource ,"Paraguay - Completion and Learning Review for the Period FY15-FY18 : IEG Review (English) 

Paraguay is an upper middle-income country with a population of 6.8 million (2017) and a GNI per capita (Atlas method) of USD 3,920 in 2017.The population is very young (60 percent under thirty years old) and the country is going through a rapid urbanization process from a low base. The country has over the last 15 years achieved solid economic growth (average GDP growth of 4.7 percent per annum) and improved shared prosperity, spurred by abundant natural resources. The CPS for the World Bank Group (WBG) had three pillars (or focus areas): (i) resilience to risks and volatility; (ii) pro-poor delivery of public goods and services; and (iii) agricultural productivity and market integration. The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) focus areas and objectives were broadly aligned with the government's National Development Plan (NDP) 2014-2030 and supported the NDP's higher level objective to reduce extreme poverty and foster income growth of the bottom 40 percent. The WBG's program components were well aligned with the NDP and addressed important development issues. The program was selective with three focus areas and eight objectives (some of which, however, contained multiple sub-objectives). The Bank demonstrated flexibility by shifting to knowledge services when the demand for IBRD lending dropped in the run-up to the election. However, the results framework had significant shortcomings which were not fully addressed at the PLR stage. The Completion and Learning Review (CLR) highlighted six lessons with which IEG concurs: (i) simplicity in project design helps speed up project implementation; (ii) investment projects may help to build governance and capacity; (iii) a realistic results framework is needed for timely achievement of objectives; (iv) a strong ASA program requires selectivity and government ownership; (v) RASs may help prioritize ASA demand and advance reforms during Paraguay's long project preparation cycles; and (vi) the flexibility afforded by programmatic ASA helps respond to changes in client needs.

Peru : rural electrification project, Web Resource ,"Peru has been one of the Latin America and the Caribbean Region’s fastest-growing economies. It grew an average 6.2 percent between 2004 and 2013. Moderate poverty was more than halved from 58 percent to 22 percent of the population between 2004 and 2015. Extreme poverty, which is mainly rural, also fell from 16 percent to 4 percent during that period. Although urban inequality declined substantially, rural inequality was reduced only modestly. To avoid a reversal of its achievements, the government needs to raise the quality of basic services, expand access to markets for the poor and vulnerable, and close infrastructure gaps to facilitate access to markets and services—all of which underscores the high priority of addressing rural electricity needs. The reform of Peru’s electricity sector in 1992 separated the generation, transmission, distribution, and regulatory functions. Based on an efficient enterprise model, the reforms introduced cost-recovery tariffs, and generation and transmission were privatized. A new regulatory body was created, and private companies are now in charge of electricity distribution in Lima and other urban centers. In rural areas, about 20 public electricity distribution companies (EDCs) provide electricity service. Most of the EDCs have performed well operationally and financially, with losses of less than 12 percent and payment rates above 95 percent. In 2005, when the first Rural Electrification Project (REP I) was appraised, Peru had a rural electrification rate of 30 percent—one of the lowest in the Region. According to the Ministry of Energy and Mines, more than 300,000 isolated households in rural areas could be reached only through renewable energy technologies, specifically individual solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Prior to REP I, service providers allocated negligible funding to meet this off-grid demand through renewable energy. The scarcity of rural electricity—coupled with the broader lack of access to infrastructure—have perpetuated the cycle of low quality of life, poor education and medical care, and limited opportunities for economic development in Peru’s rural areas.  

Ratings for this project were as follows: outcome was satisfactory, risk to development outcome was negligible, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons from this project included: i)  The promotion of productive uses of electricity needs consistent and adequate levels of technical assistance and investment support, without which their sustainability is put at risk. (ii) Achieving the financial sustainability of solar photovoltaic systems remains a challenge that the government and electricity distribution companies need to address. (iii) To reach “the last mile” of rural electrification while ensuring sustainability, the government and the EDCs need to take specific actions.

            outcome was significant, Bank performance was moderately

            Some lessons learned included: direct and sustained focus
            and clarity of vision over the entire course of
            implementation of PRSC programs that cover many years is
            required to facilitate lasting reforms particularly with
            regard to public sector governance. PRSCs can make little
            progress without a foundation of trust between the Bank and
            the government, and among development partners at the
            institutional and individual levels. The mechanisms for
            dialogue also need to evolve so that the program can
            continue to support and influence policy decisions at the
            highest strategic level. To avoid misunderstanding, the Bank
            and government can plan in advance to recalibrate the
            program at a set point during implementation. The lack of
            well-defined and realistic objectives and a fully developed

However, many important institutions of governance and public sector management, were destroyed by the ultra-radical Khmer Rouge regime, and only just started to be rebuilt. Public financial management was largely dysfunctional, posed significant fiduciary risks and oversight institutions were unfit to point out systemic problems and corruption.

Lessons suggest: 1) over-ambitious project design results in slow implementation, and will thus require restructuring; 2) lack of staff continuity, both by the Bank and borrower, can undermine successful project implementation; 3) donor coordination requires a serious degree of commitment to sector approaches, both from government, and donors to ensure success. However, project design should not be based on a sector approach until there is clear indication that such an approach will actually be adopted; 4) attempts at community mobilization failed as the adopted approach, fostered an insufficient sense of ownership in the community. This experience contrasts with that in some other African countries, in which social funds have successfully mobilized communities to contribute to school construction, and then maintain them. However, community financing for school facilities can create disparities in the quality of schooling - and has already done so in Ghana.

Dominican Republic - Country partnership strategy completion report (CPSCR) review for the period FY2010-13 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the FY2010-FY2013 Dominican Republic Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of FY2010 and the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) of FY2012, and assesses the CPS Completion Report (CPSCR). The CPS was implemented by IBRD and IFC, and this review covers the program of both institutions. The Bank Group's program had four strategic objectives, which aligned with the country's development plan, (i) strengthen social cohesion and improve access and quality of social services; (ii) promote competitiveness in a sustainable and resilient economic environment; (iii) enhance quality of public expenditures and institutional development; and (iv) build capacity and constituencies for reform. IEG rates the overall outcome as Moderately Satisfactory. Access to education increased and the coverage and quality of the social protection program improved as envisaged in the CPS. Employability of youth at-risk also improved, but mother and child healthcare quality improved less than envisaged during the CPS. In budget management, under the CPS important work began on performance-based programs, and central government agencies are now using an integrated financial management system, which is beginning to be extended to decentralized and autonomous agencies. Moreover, a larger share of government revenues is being channeled through the Single Treasury Account, which is increasing the quality of monitoring and accountability. The competitiveness pillar showed virtually no results and thus was the least successful of the four pillars in achieving objectives. The CPSCR presents a candid discussion of CPS implementation and has good lessons. The analysis of IFC's contributions is not as precise as the assessment of IBRD's work, but the completion report does give a picture of synergies between IBRD and IFC under the CPS. The CPSCR recommends that project design take into account the effort required to create consensus for reform and achieve inter-institutional coordination. Moreover, it underscores the need to strengthen Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) in the next CPS. IEG agrees with these recommendations of the CPSCR, and adds two lessons: (a) overreliance on development policy loans (DPLs) can help improve disbursement ratios but will not accelerate reform, particularly if the country and the Bank do not do the preparatory work required for such reforms; and (b) continued involvement in areas where there is a long history of slow reform, such as energy, should require evidence of a strong long-term government commitment to reform.

Ratings for the Smallholder Agriculture Development Project are as follows: Outcome was unsatisfactory, Risk to development outcome was high, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Lessons from the project include: (i) Projects that seek to improve crop productivity and income on smallholder farms, in addition to CDD, work better when they integrate the two disparate objectives because of the very different implementation modalities involved. (ii) Complex, multidimensional projects require additional oversight and support in environments with weak government implementation capacity. (iii) Creative operational approaches or sufficient institutional support is required in weak-capacity environments to ensure that project disbursements are distributed effectively. (iv) Understanding cultural impacts and how they influence agricultural cash crops in smaller, geographically isolated states is necessary to ensure that political constraints do not reduce the impact of World Bank projects.

The World Bank in Nigeria 1998-2007: Nigeria Country Assistance Evaluation, PDF file,"Following the restoration of democracy in Nigeria, the World Bank worked closely with the federal government to help achieve the government's priorities of establishing good governance, rebuilding the country's infrastructure, improving service delivery, and promoting non-oil growth. Reflecting the preference of the government, the Bank chose to initiate a large number of projects rather than to engage in up-front analytic work. Many of these projects ran into difficulties, partly because of the Bank's failure to factor into program design both the country's overall institutional weakness and the Nigerian authorities' inexperience in dealing with Bank procedures.

Economic reforms proceeded at a relatively slow pace; in mid-2003, however, the government created a reform team that acted decisively to improve fiscal discipline and public expenditure management, to make a start on public sector reform, and to introduce the changes in the institutional framework needed to address corruption. The Bank moved quickly to support these efforts, providing loan and grant support for needed capacity-building initiatives. The Bank also reevaluated its Nigeria portfolio and took steps to improve it and to ensure that it focused on priority issues. Arresting the deterioration of Nigeria's infrastructure has been a challenge; although the track record is littered with setbacks, support from the Bank now holds promise to help the government make tangible progress in this area. 

The focus of Bank support is now shifting to Nigeria's 36 states. The state governments control roughly half of the country's public resources and carry the bulk of responsibility for service delivery. A key challenge facing the Bank is how to engage effectively with these governments. The approach proposed by the Bank, which entailed identifying âlead states,â held promise; however, it was not fully operationalized. 

Overall, the outcomes of the Bank program in Nigeria are rated as moderately unsatisfactory.  This rating recognizes the improvement later in the period reviewed in macro-economic management following the appointment of the reform team, but balances this against the moderately unsatisfactory progress in infrastructure development and service delivery.   Working with state governments to ensure that the substantial resources they receive translate into real improvements in the lives of Nigerian citizens, most notably the country's poor, is the most important challenge facing the Bank in the next 5â10 years.",Country :  Nigeria,Content Type : Reports,"July 1, 2010

Although the JAS was jointly implemented by the World Bank and the African Development Bank , this review covers only the program of the World Bank. 

The JAS objectives were organized under two main pillars: (i) strengthening the institutional framework for economic management and public service, and (ii) enhancing productive capacity and accelerating growth and competitiveness.

IEG concurs with the lessons identified in the JASCR, and underscores three additional points. First, guidelines pertaining to the role of partner institutions, resource requirements to facilitate the process, and procedures for interaction within and between the partner institutions need to be clarified before such collaboration is initiated. Second, harmonization in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness explicitly requires government ownership and leadership. Consequently, capacity support to the Government in this respect should be explicitly incorporated in the partnership program.

Nigeria - Country partnership strategy progress report for FY2010-FY2013 : IEG CPSCR review, Web Resource ,"The review examines the implementation of the FY2010-FY2013 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of FY2010 and the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) of FY2012. The strategy was jointly designed and implemented by IDA, the African Development Bank, the UK Department for International Development, and the US Agency for International Development. Although the CPS and CPSPR made reference to the IFC program insofar as it would complement the IDA program, both documents were presented without formal endorsement from IFC, and the CPSCR has limited discussion of IFC activities; this review covers only IDA activities. The Bank has been consistent in using the pillars of the 2004 National Economic and Environmental Development Strategy for 2005-2007 (NEEDS) in all three CPS' in Nigeria since 2004. The objectives of the FY2010 CPS were organized under the three pillars of the NEEDS. The CPSPR confirmed the validity of the CPS approach, and provided a new meta-objective, âMitigating the Impact of the Global Economic Crisis.â It introduced significant changes to the results matrix, which on the whole lowered the bar for success. IEG rates the overall outcome of IDA support as moderately satisfactory, concurring with the CPSCR rating. Consistent support from the Bank over an extended period of time contributed to significant progress in developing the institutional framework for the power sector. Good progress was also achieved in agricultural development, with significant impact on poverty reduction. A series of modest steps were taken in the right direction to strengthen the institutions and systems for better governance, although there seems to lack a scale-up strategy for replicating these initial efforts, especially at the state level. Moreover, the positive achievements were partly offset by disappointing results in other areas of Bank engagement: although urban transport in Lagos improved, progress was limited in the overall transport network; while there was progress in post-basic education, polio, and maternal health care, little was achieved in basic education, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and institutional reforms in the social sectors. In addition, there was limited progress in environmental management and PPP. Finally, in spite of a substantial and well thought through support effort by the Bank, Nigeriaâs business environment deteriorated in many ways during the CPS period. IEG concurs with the four key lessons drawn in the CPSCR, and wishes to underscore three additional points. First, there is a need for close and careful portfolio management throughout the project cycle. The Nigeria program has few examples of project turn-around and there should be a real burden of proof on the supervision team that optimism is warranted. Second, there is a need for greater strategic coherence, not just in the preparation of the CPS document but in the follow through in program implementation. A concerted effort to enhance governance and to address poverty should be the challenges of the next CPS. Finally, there is a need to develop a strong results framework that provides a clear line of sights for strategic decision making and accountability. This requires an explicit results chain that links Bank interventions, the complementary actions by the government and partners, and other critical factors, to the strategic objectives, as well as a results matrix that is stable enough for tracking results.

India - Andhra Pradesh Forestry Project, Web Resource ,"The audit concurs with the ratings of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of highly satisfactory outcomes, high institutional development, and likely sustainability. Likewise, the Borrower performance is rated satisfactory; in contrast though, the Bank performance, while generally good, compels an unsatisfactory performance rating, due to a violation of the Involuntary Resettlement safeguard. Lessons convey, first, that it is possible to turn around the strategy of a large public entity from command-and-control, to community participation quite quickly, given commitment at high levels. Therefore, sustained, skills development for government staff, and for stakeholders in participatory processes, over periods longer than a single project is necessary. Second, in any tribal forest situation, there is a high potential for involuntary resettlement. During the project review, Bank management should carefully question claims in natural forest management projects, where involuntary resettlement issues should be anticipated. Third, even where a high percentage of the poor are forest dependent, it is much easier to manage forests for trees, than for the poor; hence, equitable distribution of the benefits, needs early attention through pro-poor policy, government and community processes, and resource management systems. Fourth, economic analysis of community development interventions will usually be incomplete, if it assesses only the net benefits associated with members themselves, or their allocated area. This is because others may have previously utilized resources inside the boundary, and also because members may have previously utilized resources outside the boundary.",Country :  India,Content Type : Reports,"July 8, 2002

Lao People’s Democratic Republic : second education development project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses a primary education project in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Second Education Development Project, commonly known as EDP2. This program was financed by the World Bank and the government of Australia. The project was approved in April 2004, and closed in
August 2013. The World Bank’s total contribution was $28.2 million.
This report was prepared by Erik Bloom, Senior Economist, IEG and Inthansone Phetsering, consultant. The findings are based on an extensive review of the literature, project reports, and a field visit, December 4–18, 2016. This mission included a field visit to Oudamxay province. The mission talked to current and retired staff involved in the
project’s implementation in the Ministry of Education and Sports and with staff from the World Bank and the government of Australia. The mission also met with education officials at the province and district levels in Oudamxay province. The mission also visited five remote schools in two districts. As much as possible, the PPAR cites publically available documents, and when appropriate, it refers to interviews and internal documents. 
The project’s credit agreement states the project’s development objective as: To assist the Borrower to achieve universal completion of primary education by implementing the education policies and reform actions set forth in its Letter of Education Policy, including increasing access to, and the completion of, primary school in the project provinces, improving the quality of access to, and the completion of, primary school in the project provinces, improving the quality of

"Jordan - Agriculture Sector Adjustment, and Agricultural Sector Technical Support Projects", Web Resource ,"This audit report somehow differs from the Implementation Completion Report, and Evaluation Summary ' s (ES) assessment, in that it downgrades the outcome ratings of both the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL), and Agricultural Sector Technical Support (ASTS) Projects to moderately satisfactory, but upgrades the ASAL ' s institutional development to substantial, while concurs with the ES ' s rating on the ASTS ' institutional development as modest. However, the consistent ratings in both operations show likely sustainability, and satisfactory performances from both the Bank, and Borrower. The experience of the two projects, confirm key lessons from the Operations Evaluation Department as follows. The overly ambitious ASAL project design - in addressing both agriculture sector/trade and water reforms - was limited by political constraints, given farmers could not at the same time, pay more for water, and be constricted by the elimination of subsidies, and loss of import protection. Instead, the ASAL could have been an appropriate instrument for institutional reform of the water sector, had the Bank better understood the government ' s concerns on social, poverty, and employment impacts of higher agricultural water tariffs, and worked in a participatory, more incremental approach to address these concerns. This harmed the Bank ' s credibility, for although the cross-sectoral and strategic framework for water and agriculture, were supportive (even accepted by stakeholders) of increased water tariffs, at approval time it was clear that a second water tariff increase would be politically unrealistic. Thus, the second tranche release undermined donor partnerships, and mislead the government towards wrongful tariff increases. The above confirms that reforms cannot be imposed, and the Bank needs to be more sensitive to the political economy of reform, acceptability, and timing.",Country :  Jordan,Content Type : Reports,"January 31, 2003

Tanzania - Secod Port Modernization and Railway Restructuring Projects, Web Resource ,"The audit concurs overall with the Implementation Completion Report's (ICR) ratings of satisfactory project outcome, likely sustainability, substantial institutional development impacts, and satisfactory performances by both the Bank and Borrower, as it concerns the Second Port Modernization Project (PMPII); yet, regarding the assessment of the Railway Restructuring Project (RRP) the audit, although largely concurs with the ICR ratings of unsatisfactory project outcome, yet substantial institutional development impacts, and satisfactory performances by the Bank and Borrower, slightly differs on the unlikely sustainability rating, assessing this as non evaluable, and, also differs on the ICR Review rating of the Borrower, upgrading same from unlikely to satisfactory. The audit confirms the following lessons. The freedom to operate according to market principles potentially makes the operational efficiency of privately run concessions, superior to that of parastatal organizations for ports and railways. Thus, the concentration of investment with high volumes of traffic, lower operational costs, and relative autonomy from government, generally makes port concessions a relatively low risk for investors. Yet, if railways are likely to incur losses, and/or are inadequately compensated for uneconomic services, investors will be hard to come, and therefore bidding conditions, and the terms of the concession agreement will need to take this fact into account. The design of projects preparing parastatal companies for privatization should also consider the capacity, and commitment of government, and management to carry through the reform process. Targets and timetables should be realistic, and, special care should be placed in the selection of qualified consultants preparing bidding documentation.",Country :  Tanzania,Content Type : Reports,"June 22, 2005

Paraguay - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY09-FY13, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the FY09-FY13 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of FY09 and the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) of FY12, and assesses the CPS Completion Report (CPSCR). The CPS was an IBRD-only strategy although IFC did have operations in Paraguay during the CPS period. The Bank strategy focused on improving governance to combat corruption; alleviating poverty and reducing extreme poverty; and fostering growth with a focus on generating employment and improving income distribution. The political context of this CPS was complicated. Many Bank initiatives were uncertain, especially after June 2012, when the President was removed from office. No Bank new lending or TA was approved between June 2012 and April 2013. In this difficult policy environment the results of the Bank program were mixed. Indicators of governance and corruption did not improve significantly. Paraguay remains at the bottom of the World Economic Forum's ranking on the indicator of diversion of public funds due to corruption, with the rating virtually unchanged at 1.8 out of 7 during the CPS. The country made some progress on reducing poverty, and the percentage of the population below the poverty line decreased from 35.1 percent in 2009 to 23.8 percent in 2013 according to the World Development Indicators. However, there was only minor improvement in alleviating extreme poverty which is concentrated in rural areas, and income inequality has continued to deteriorate despite a growing economy

St. Lucia - Economic and Social Development Policy Loan and Credit Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report assesses the Uganda Second Local Government Development Project (2003 to 2008). The project's development objective was to improve Local Governments' institutional performance for sustainable, decentralized service delivery, particularly for the poor. It built on lessons from the previous operation, and sought to support implementation efforts as an important step toward achieving the Millennium Development goals in education, health, and access to water. The project's overall outcome is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Key lessons identified were, (i) Policy reversals can cause serious damage to otherwise significant project outcomes, and are difficult to counter. District proliferation or reduction in un-earmarked funding, or Local Governments' rights to raise revenues, need to be monitored closely as these could be early signals of policy reversal. (ii) Monitoring should be focused on outcome indicators as well as process indicators; moreover, indicators are best unified across sectors. (iii) Decentralization is not a sector, while it was treated as such in Uganda with a Sector Working Group, a Sector Investment Plan, and specific donor support. Decentralization of service delivery affects all economic sectors and should be supported in a harmonized way across sectors and donor programs. (iv) Many conditional grants to Local Governments are funded through donor programs. A fully decentralized sector allocation, supported through government budgets, however, requires changes to ways of donor fund allocations across sectors, given that such allocations cannot be determined a priori. This is even more important in case Local Governments and communities have authority to do so, while, on the other hand, incompatibilities exist in this regard, such as those related to development cooperation frameworks or to sector-specific earmarking of funds by teams.

China : thermal power efficiency project, Web Resource ,"The China Thermal Power Efficiency project sought to reduce coal consumption and greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity in three provinces in China – Shanxi, Shandong and Guangdong. The project was conceived as a response to the predominance of coal in China’s energy mix and the need to find ways of improving existing infrastructure over and above weaning the country away from this reliance as an energy source. China’s rising energy demand had relied heavily on domestic coal production and the rapid expansion of local thermal power generation plants that utilized this coal. Increasingly, these plants were having adverse environmental impacts, particularly in regions experiencing significant increases in energy demand from manufacturing sector.

Ratings for the project are as follows: Outcome is satisfactory, Risk to development outcome is moderate, Bank performance is satisfactory, Borrower performance is satisfactory, and Monitoring and Evaluation is satisfactory. Lessons from the project include: (i) Piloting and demonstrating potential technological improvements to lower costs and improve environmental performance works well in environments where operators are risk averse and constrained by government policy. (ii) The World Bank’s international experience and expertise has the capacity to make an important contribution to pollution reduction in the thermal power sector. (iii) External help and international expertise provided by World Bank projects at the provincial level in middle income countries helps support and reinforce successful central government policy. (iii) Analytical work needs to respond to the immediate needs of the sector rather than being determined by supply-side factors. (iv) A ‘hands-off’ approach by the World Bank in high capacity environments can lead to missed opportunities in maximizing a project’s potential. (v) Barriers to the closure of small inefficient power units are often political. Fostering the key relationships with partners is essential in knowing what and how reforms can be implemented in challenging environments.

review period, Brazil’s annual economic growth declined from 4.1 percent prior to the CPS (2008-

monetary conditions during 2010-11 and adverse external trade and financing environments, an
unsustainable fiscal stance after 2011, and political instability that undermined investors’
confidence. Reduced growth impacted poverty. Brazil achieved an impressive reduction of extreme
poverty rates, from 9.9 percent in 2001 to 2.8 percent in 2014. This reduction was associated with a
decline in inequality, from a Gini index of 59.3 in 2001 to 51.4 in 2014. However, as a result of
lower growth, poverty increased again in 2015 to about 3.4 percent. The extreme poverty rate in
rural areas (9.1 percent in 2013) is higher than in urban areas (3.1 percent in 2013). Brazil’s Human

Ratings for the Natural Resources Management Project were as follows: outcome was unsatisfactory; risk to the development outcome was significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included from the project: it is essential to gauge support at higher levels of government than the concerned environmental agencies. Care has to be taken that international environmental pressure, vested interests and the understandable enthusiasm of the Bank's own appraisal process does not lead to financing of worthy causes that governments are unwilling to support. Care has to be taken that individuals and community stakeholders are empowered in the decision-making process, particularly over allocation of rights to utilize natural resources. The assessed projects clearly show that insecure property rights allied with centralized, top-down award of concessions to commercial operations and capture of economic rents creates conflict and promotes non-sustainable natural resource utilization. When partners operate on differing schedules and priorities there is a danger that mixed signals will be passed to the in-country stakeholders.

IEG concurs with the CASCR rating of the overall outcome of IDA Strategy for Ethiopia as moderately satisfactory, although in its view the rating is very borderline.  The CASCR rates IDA achievement against a narrowly defined set of outcome indicators, and IEG's recognition of this provides the basis for its concurrence with the CASCR's overall outcome rating. Nevertheless, in IEG's judgment, several unaddressed policy imbalances, structural constraints and governance issues pose significant risks to the results of the IDA program and their sustainability.

One major lesson from the CAS/CASPR/CASCR is that, going forward, it is important for IDA to take a broader view of sustainability and to adopt a long-term vision in its risk analysis.", ,Content Type : Reports,"September 14, 2012

Morocco - Water Resources Management Project, Web Resource ,"This Performance Assessment Report assesses the Water Resources Management Project (WRMP) implemented by the World Bank in Morocco from fiscal 1998 to 2004. In 1995 the Moroccan government passed a comprehensive water law to reform its water sector, as it sought to address overtaxed groundwater resources and decreasing reservoir levels. The objectives for the WRMP were to help the government of Morocco promote comprehensive water management that would be economically efficient, equitable, and environmentally sustainable. The project aimed to support the establishment of an institutional framework for integrated water resources management and the creation of one River Basin Agency, improve capacity in water resources planning and management, improve water use efficiency, increase the effectiveness of the existing hydraulic infrastructure, and introduce water pollution control measures.
IEG rated the overall project outcome as moderately satisfactory. Shortcomings occurred with respect to the project's efficiency and with a program to control waterborne diseases. IEG rated the project's risk to development outcome as moderate. Both the Bank and the borrower performance were rated satisfactory. The assessment highlights the importance of unlimited access to credible environmental data and the use of geographic information system software during environmental monitoring.",Country :  Morocco,Content Type : Reports,"June 1, 2009

Niger - Completion and learning review for the country partnership framework and country partnership strategy for the period FY13-FY16 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"Niger is a landlocked and sparsely populated country in the Sahel region of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with significant deposits of uranium, gold, coal, and petroleum. Given its reliance on mining and oil exports, the country is exposed to external economic shocks directly and indirectly through the impact on its main trading partner, Nigeria. During the CPS period, GDP grew at a yearly average of 5.2 percent and its population at 3.9 percent. The country's average GNI income per capita was $395, considerably well below the SSA average of $1,642. The deterioration in the primary budget deficit led to an increase in the public debt over GDP driven by an ambitious public investment program. Poverty incidence declined from 53.7 percent in 2005 to 44.5 percent in 2014, but remained stagnant in rural areas at 51.4 percent, while it dropped to 8.7 percent in the capital city and other urban areas. The 2016 UNDP Human Development Index (HDI) and the Gender Inequality Index ranked Niger amongst the lowest in the world, 187 out of 188 and 157 out of 159 countries, respectively. Niger has suffered from conflict in neighboring countries. Niger hosts around 340,000 refugees and internally displaced persons. Climate change is affecting (rain-fed) agriculture, the source of income for most of its population. After a military coup in 2010, the new government elected in 2011 issued a Plan for Social and Economic Development (PDES) which identified five programmatic areas: (i) strengthening the credibility and efficiency of public institutions; (ii) creating the conditions for inclusive, sustainable and balanced development; (iii) food security and sustainable agricultural development; (iv) competitive and diversified economy for accelerated, inclusive growth; and (v) promotion of social development.

Peru – Sierra Rural Development Project, Web Resource ,"This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Peru Sierra Rural Development Project (P079165). The assessment will contribute to learning from projects that seek to increase the integration of small-scale producers with market value chains. The loan agreement stated that the project development objective was to assist the Borrower in improving the assets and economic conditions of rural families in selected areas of the Borrower’s Apurímac, Ayacucho, Huancavelica, Junín, Huánuco, and Pasco regions, and strengthen government capacity to implement an integrated Sierra development strategy.

Ratings for the Sierra Rural Development Project are as follows: Outcomes was satisfactory, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Quality of monitoring and evaluation was substantial. Four lessons from the experience of this assessment include: (i) Subproject investments by producer groups are more likely to be viable when the selection of subprojects is competitive and demand-driven, and it entails a substantial producer contribution to subproject cost. (ii) Building partnerships between actors in the market value chain is difficult and, in some circumstances, may not be feasible in the short term. (iii) Subproject investments by producer groups give a one-off boost to poor producer households without necessarily ensuring that they will continue to grow, or that the groups to which they belong will become stronger. (iv) Ensuring complementarity between subproject investments by producer groups and government-financed infrastructure and services, although hard to achieve, is important for maximizing impact.

"Georgia : first, second and third development policy operations", Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Review (PPAR) evaluates a programmatic series of three development policy operations (DPOs) for Georgia, including three credits and one loan, in the amount of $85 million for DPO-I, $50 million for DPO-II, and $40 million for DPO-III, implemented between July 2009 (World Bank Board of Executive Directors approval of DPO-I) and March 2012 (closing of DPO-III). All operations were fully disbursed. The Government of Georgia requested these operations in a context of economic downturn resulting from the August 2008 conflict with the Russian Federation and the global financial crisis.

Ratings for the First, Second and Third Development Policy Operations are as follows: Outcome is satisfactory, Risk to development outcome is moderate, Bank performance is satisfactory, and Borrow performance is satisfactory. Among the key lessons are the following: (i) DPO programs during times of crisis may involve a trade-off between providing predictable budget support and the quality of the reform agenda. (ii)  Although scaling up Georgia’s TSA program was fully justified, cash transfer programs are mainly geared toward the chronically poor, whereas many persons affected by crises fall into temporary poverty. (iii) In a fiscally constrained environment, a move to universal health coverage may not necessarily bring an improvement in the financial protection of the poor. (iv) The World Bank can play a significant role in helping focus government’s efforts in policy areas where other development partners mainly support reforms, such as in the trade-related reforms required to negotiate Georgia’s Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the EU.

Vietnam – Water Resources Assistance Project, Web Resource ,"When the Vietnam Water Resources Assistance Project (VWRAP) was designed, Vietnam was the world’s second largest rice exporter, but land and labor productivity was relatively low in comparison with neighboring countries. About half of cultivated land was irrigated. Ninety-six percent of the nation’s 7,600 dams were used for irrigation, but the hydraulic infrastructure was deteriorating, and dam safety monitoring was considered inadequate. A major constraint to improving agricultural productivity was underperformance of the large rice-based flood irrigation systems, because of their outdated infrastructure and institutional design. The government of Vietnam had initiated a broad-based program to modernize agriculture and requested World Bank assistance to finance a project that would introduce innovative approaches to irrigation modernization and address dam safety issues. The project development objectives were to modernize and increase the productivity of Vietnamese agriculture, improve the management of water resources, and reduce dam safety risks. 

Ratings for this project are as follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons from the project include: (i) The Project’s close alignment with the government of Socialist Republic of Vietnam’s agriculture reform programs allowed it to pilot innovations that have had enduring policy impacts. (ii) Irrigation modernization is a complex learning process that requires time and a phased approach. (iii) Key results indicators and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) frameworks should be linked to development objectives and a clearly stated theory of change. (iv) For affordability reasons, water user fees may be insufficient to ensure the financial viability of water user groups; in that case, additional sources of funds including subsidies may need to be considered.",Country :  Vietnam,Content Type : Reports,"August 20, 2019

It was a complex project that aimed at implementing the government's decentralization strategy in the education sector and improving management capacity at the central, district, and local levels.
The outcome of the Basic and Primary School Project II is rated moderately satisfactory. The project decentralized decision-making; it facilitated systemic expansion and resulted in a substantial increase of education access for girls and disadvantaged groups. However, activities aimed at improving quality of education had modest results and a limited effect on learning outcomes.

China - Nature Reserves Management Project, Web Resource ,"Ratings for the Nature Reserves Management Project for China were as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was substantial; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned from the projects included: before sophisticated approaches to planning and information management can be useful for biodiversity conservation, protected-area managers first need to have a strong understanding of the adaptive management approach and skills in each of its steps; defining outcomes, formulating measurable objectives targeted to achieving them, collecting and analyzing data on the relevant indicators with reliable methods to assess the success of efforts, and revising approaches in light o f the results. For greater effectiveness and relevance, projects or components facilitating the development of biodiversity-friendly, community-supported livelihood schemes where borrower agencies lack experience with them will need to: (1) provide for greater training, closer monitoring and continuous technical support of staff responsible for engaging with communities to identify and plan sub-projects; and (2) demonstrate the biodiversity and livelihood impacts of such schemes on meaningful scales, particularly in countries where resource use pressures on biodiversity is high. These steps will make it more likely that capacity in this area will be sustained and extended to other protected areas, and greater borrower ownership and resources for biodiversity-supporting poverty reduction will be generated. Programs to scale-down or close resource-extraction enterprises in remote, rural areas for the benefit of biodiversity, and to equitably transfer workers displaced as a result to new livelihoods, can face numerous challenges; weak, uneven and unpredictable markets and opportunities, government economic policies, and the skill-level and social composition of the displaced workers. Such programs therefore need to carefully consider and be tailored around these factors, including the viability of alternate enterprises and existing opportunities in other sectors in the region. Furthermore, it is important that their design involves local government, as it has the knowledge of local realities and hence of what would be feasible.",Country :  China,Content Type : Reports,"May 30, 2008

Sao Tome and Principe - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) and country partnership strategy completion report (CPSCR) review for the period FY2006-12 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the FY2006-FY2009 Sao Tome and Principe Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of FY2005, and the FY2011-FY2012 Interim Strategy Note of FY2011. While the CPS was an IDA-only strategy, the ISN was jointly implemented by IDA and IFC. This review covers the joint program of the two institutions. The overall objective of the CPS was to support implementation of the country's Poverty Reduction Support Program (PRSP). The ISN built on the CPS, continuing the support to government's emphasis on eliminating constraints to growth but taking into account the uncertainties of the potential inflow of oil revenues. World Bank Group (WBG) support under the ISN was organized under two pillars, (i) accelerating sustainable and broad-based economic growth; and (ii) strengthening governance, public institutions, and human capital. IEG rates the overall outcome as Moderately Satisfactory. Under Pillar I, the Bank achieved its objective of increasing competition in the telecommunications sector. There was substantial progress in strengthening the fiscal regulatory framework. Progress was mixed both in terms of improving the business climate and of aid coordination. Results in the energy sector were not achieved, and financial intermediation and access to credit did not improve. Under Pillar II, results were achieved in the area of budgetary operations where transparency and accountability were improved as well as the effectiveness of budget execution. Objectives in the education sector were mostly achieved as access and efficiency improved but no evidence was provided to support improvements in quality. Development of a second PRSP was mostly achieved. Results were partially achieved given that the country remained to be Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)-compliant, and no further progress on strengthening the National Petroleum Agency was reported. Objectives in the health sector were partially achieved as access improved but there was no evidence of improvements in quality and efficiency. The objective of increasing capacity of coastal fisheries to address climate variation was not achieved. The CPSCR outlined nine lessons for the next CPS. IEG agrees with these lessons and underscores two additional points. First, faulty design of results frameworks has a negative impact on the ability to take stock of the impact of the WBG on development outcomes and diminishes their usefulness as a monitoring and management tool. Second, proposed WBG interventions should be capable of achieving the CPS / ISN objectives and contribute in a significant way to the country development goals (i.e., the results chain linking WBG interventions to the country development goals must be strong and clear).

The objective of the Project was to develop a sustainable and well functioning land administration system that is fair, efficient, cost effective, decentralized, and that enhances land tenure security.  IEG rates the project's overall outcome as moderately unsatisfactory.  
IEG derives five lessons: i) Attempts to harmonize customary and statutory land tenure institutions will not be successful if the conflicts of interest over rent allocation are not addressed, and if priority is not given to distributing rents in accordance with the public good; ii) Land tenure reform calls for a long-term commitment by the government and its development partners; this commitment may be facilitated by a programmatic lending instrument but the commitment must precede the choice of instrument--the instrument will not by itself create the necessary commitment; iii) The Bank's annual Doing Business survey may give a misleading impression about trends in the efficiency of property registration services; iv) Although the Bank's good practice guidelines indicate that the efficiency of land administration services tends to be higher when they are handled by a single agency, in practice, consolidating land agencies will not by itself ensure that their efficiency will improve; and v) Projects with multiple co-financiers are risky: if each insists on imposing its own procurement and disbursement procedures implementation may be delayed, and the strategic priorities of the partners may diverge in the course of project implementation, undermining support for achieving the project outcomes that were originally agreed to.",Country :  Ghana,Content Type : Reports,"June 5, 2013

Morocco - Country partnership strategy completion report (CPSCR) review for the period FY2010-13 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the 2010-2013 Morocco Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of FY2010 and the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) of FY2012, and assesses the CPS Completion Report (CPSCR). The strategy was jointly implemented by the IBRD and IFC, and this review covers the joint program of the two institutions. The CPS program was aligned and its results framework mapped well onto development outcomes derived from Morocco's Social and Economic Development Reform Program. In this context the CPS aimed to contribute in three broad areas to support, (i) growth, competitiveness, and employment; (ii) service delivery to citizens; and (iii) sustainable development in a changing climate. In addition, all CPS activities were to address two crosscutting issues, governance and territoriality. The CPSPR confirmed the ongoing relevance of the CPS pillars but also introduced new emphasis on governance, inclusion, and voice as well as subsidy reform. IEG rates the overall outcome of World Bank Group (WBG) support as moderately satisfactory. Overall, the CPS program largely achieved its business environment and financial sector reform objectives and made a significant contribution in the area of social exclusion in terms of participation, access, transparency and ownership. Good progress was also made in relation to broad environmental challenges such as water management, solid waste, and renewable energy. The inclusion of high level objectives in the results framework would have helped to better define the program and lending choices made. The CPSPR does provide detail on baselines and targets associated with indicators, but many of these relate to intermediate or process related measures from which it is difficult to discern on-the-ground impact. Most indicators had baseline and target values that were reported on, although we note that where targets are exceeded, Bank efforts are presented as positive whereas underperformance is often presented as over-reaching. The CPSCR presents a number of valuable lessons, including (a) the value of deep, high level and broader stakeholder engagement and dialogue that contributes to the development of a rounded understanding of the political economy on the part of the WBG, and to greater levels of participatory ownership on the part of the client and other stakeholders; (b) the utility of a flexible approach in a fast-changing context that allows for considered, but rapid, adaptation to demand and need; (c) the added value of analytic and advisory activities (AAA) in terms of economic and sector work (ESW) that provides a sound analytical, knowledge base for lending, investment and action, and of technical assistance (TA) that helps to support the actual implementation of planned reform (particularly important in a potentially volatile context); and, (d) the increasing importance of cross-sectoral work to tackle cross-cutting issues, and recognition of the potential risks inherent in this due to increased complexity associated with the issues themselves, but also with the requirement to deal with multiple authorities, agencies and other actors. The latter will require enhanced management capacity, negotiation skills and other qualities and competencies going forward. The CPSCR also notes the effectiveness of single-sector development policy lending (DPL) in progressing first generation reforms, particularly where there are weaknesses in cross-ministerial coordination. We concur with that finding; however, we also note that where country teams are afforded considerable flexibility in how strategy is pursued, there is a parallel responsibility to ensure that the potential to measure and assess the realization of strategy is made apparent through the articulation of clearly stated, high level objectives that are further defined through appropriate indicators.

The CPS objectives were articulated under two strategic pillars: (i) addressing vulnerabilities through macroeconomic stabilization and positioning of Armenia for post-crisis growth; poverty alleviation amidst assured health and social protection; and reduction of rural and environmental risks; and (ii) strengthening competitiveness for post-crisis growth by focusing on improved governance to boost public sector efficiency and strengthened foundation for knowledge economy and competitiveness. The CPSPR confirmed the relevance of the two pillars and maintained all the CPS objectives.
IEG rates the overall outcome of the CPS as moderately satisfactory, below the CPSCR rating of satisfactory. World Bank Group (WBG) assistance contributed to significant progress in expanding financial intermediation (including to small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs)), improving the business process in revenue agencies, expanding internet penetration and lowering its access cost, improving water services, and reforming the financing and quality assurance systems in education. Good progress was made in increasing the potential area for irrigation, the adoption of best practice mining legislation, improvement in communal pasture management, efficiency in public expenditure management, civil service assessment, and rule bound judicial decisions. The WBG's work in reforming the tax regime and  administration was strategically important and contributed to the implementation of important reforms, although persistent governance issues call for additional efforts to improve performance in this area. There was also partial progress in road network rehabilitation. On the other hand, the Bank played a relatively minor role in the restoration of Armenia's macroeconomic stability while the country continues to face external current account vulnerability. While the Bank's temporary jobs program and the promotion of safe-gas heating in schools and multi-apartment buildings were successful, their relatively small size and the absence of a scale-up strategy limited the impact on the poor. Poverty increased during the CPS period, poverty targeting fell short of expectations, and the results in the health sector were mixed. Similarly, WBG projects contributed to progress in the energy sector, but the progress was timid in relation to the substantial needs and there is no evidence of a scale-up mechanism. 
The CPSCR draws nine key lessons, but without a sense of priority. IEG supports these lessons, but considers that there are more important lessons than the ones identified. First, instead of spreading across all areas of Armenia's development needs, the WBG assistance should focus on the most critical priorities that have an impact on growth, poverty reduction and social inclusion. Second, there is a need to step-up the efforts to overcome the resistance to reforms by vested interests by reaching out to lawmakers, government officials, and other domestic stakeholders. Third, a good results framework should include not just indicators for measuring WBG project implementation, but also a clear results chain that shows the critical assumptions whose fulfillment is required for WBG interventions to achieve the CPS objectives.",Country :  Armenia,Content Type : Reports,"October 24, 2013

Mozambique - Southern Africa Regional Gas Project, Web Resource ,"When the Southern Africa Regional Gas Project (SARGP) was approved in November 2003, Mozambique had seen strong economic growth since the end of the civil war in 1992 but faced challenges in improving its business environment and attracting foreign investment. Although Mozambique’s gas reserves had been discovered in the 1960s, they remained undeveloped. The World Bank had provided advice and technical assistance to help develop the gas fields since 1991. In 2000, the government signed an agreement with the South African petrochemical company, Sasol, under which Sasol would develop the gas reserves in Mozambique and export natural gas to South Africa over a 25-year period. The stated objective of the SARGP was to help: “initiate the development and export of Mozambique’s substantial natural gas resources in an environmentally sustainable manner, thereby contributing towards economic growth and poverty reduction in Mozambique.” 

The project ratings are as follows: Outcome was satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was negligible to low, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons from this experience include: (i) The PRG instrument can provide distinct risk mitigation to support a first-of-kind public-private partnership project in an untested policy and regulatory environment. (ii) Even as a late entrant into a project’s financing structure, the Bank Group can leverage its presence to enhance E&S safeguards and community development initiatives.  (iii) Some flexibility in concession agreements to review price mechanism clauses in the event of extreme divergence from initial assumptions can help enhance long-term viability of a public-private partnership project. (iv) Coordination of corporate local community development initiatives with local government programs can help enhance their sustainability. (v) Proactive measures by the sponsor company to develop local suppliers are likely to be needed to ensure upstream linkages in extractive industry projects.

Bulgaria - social inclusion project, Web Resource ,"Bulgaria is a middle-income country that joined the European Union (EU) in 2007. After setbacks in social well-being and economic growth precipitated by the 2008 global economic crisis, Bulgaria has recently made progress in improving economic performance and reducing poverty. However, it faces the formidable challenge of addressing persistent pockets of poverty and social exclusion. Poverty in Bulgaria is linked with low levels of education, high unemployment, rural residence, belonging to an ethnic minority, female gender, and old age. Social exclusion is both a cause of poverty and a consequence. Fighting poverty and social exclusion is a priority of Bulgaria, and education a key component of its national policies. The objective of the Social Inclusion Project (SIP) is “to promote social inclusion through increasing the school readiness of children below the age of seven, targeting low income and marginalized families, including children with a disability and other special needs” (World Bank 2008a). The objective did not change during the life of the project.

Ratings for the Social Inclusion Project are as follows: Outcome is moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome is moderate, Bank and Borrower performance are both moderately satisfactory. The following lessons, offered to this end, are relevant to both the World Bank and the government: (i) Official databases are important, but may need to be complemented with mapping of target communities and households and their needs, priorities, motivations, and dynamics, undertaken by those with intimate knowledge of the community and with community development expertise. (ii) Mobile services and mediators face challenges in reaching target populations, especially when mediators are few relative to their target populations and have heavy workloads, and they do not always share the language, culture, and living conditions of those populations. (iii) Low appreciation of evidence for learning, program refinement, and policymaking can undermine the effectiveness of programs and policies, especially where piloting is intended. The development of M&E capacities could provide MLSP with a critical management tool for ensuring continuous learning and accountability for ECD results and increase its potential for resource mobilization and future replication. (iii) Experience under the SIP reveals the scope and opportunity to clarify roles and responsibilities to optimize comparative advantages and synergies of the many actors involved both horizontally (across partners at each level of the system) and vertically (up and down the various levels of decentralized government). (iv) Investments in ECD and social inclusion activities targeted to low-income and marginalized children ages 0–7 years and their parents are necessary, but they are insufficient to ensure the children’s success and inclusion in primary school and beyond.

Guatemala - Completion and learning review for country partnership strategy for the period FY2013-2016 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This Review assesses the design and implementation of the World Bank Group’s (WBG)
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Guatemala covering the period FY13-16. Following the
shared approach methodology, the program’s development outcomes are assessed based on the
Performance Learning Review (PLR) which was undertaken towards the end of the CPS period in
September 2015. Guatemala is a lower middle income country and the largest economy in Central America.
During the CPS period, Guatemala had been implementing prudent macroeconomic policies with a
relatively stable GDP growth rate. However, shared prosperity, as measured by income growth
among the poorest 40 percent of the population, declined during 2000-2014. Guatemala’s Gini
coefficient of income and human development index in 2014 continued to lag the Latin America and
Caribbean (LAC) region. Low public revenue collection limited the ability of the State to provide
basic public goods and services, and to undertake public investment essential to achieving its
development goals. Guatemala has weak institutional quality, scoring in the lowest quartile in three
and below the median in all of the six Worldwide Governance Indicators, with no significant
improvement over the last two decades. IEG rates WBG performance as Fair.

More specifically, the project aimed to expand access, improve educational quality, increase systemic efficiency and effectiveness, provide materials to stem the spread of HIV/AIDS, strengthen implementation capacity, and encourage provision of private secondary education.
IEG rates the outcome of the Secondary Education Project as moderately unsatisfactory. Risk to development outcome is rated significant; although there is much demand for secondary education, the maintenance status of the new buildings and sustainability of expenditures are uncertain. Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory, due to a moderately satisfactory quality at entry, a high turnover of task managers, and a limited attention to the educational components of the project. Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory, because of long-term delays, scarcity of counterpart funds, failure to appoint competent staff to manage the project, and governance issues.",Country :  Malawi,Content Type : Reports,"January 29, 2010

Haiti - Port-Au-Prince Neighborhood Housing Reconstruction, Web Resource ,"Haiti is one of the poorest countries worldwide, and it has suffered from a long history of natural disasters, compounded with high poverty, weak institutions, and political instability. A major earthquake struck Haiti in January 2010, centered near the capital Port au Prince. About 220,000 people were killed and 300,000 wounded. Damage to buildings and infrastructure was estimated at US$ 7.8 billion, exceeding 100% of the country’s GDP. Over a million people were displaced and settled in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps. Already weak government capacity was
further overwhelmed with the deaths of 16,000 staff members. The original project objective was to help residents of selected Port-au-Prince Neighborhoods severely affected by the earthquake return to their communities by supporting them to repair and/or reconstruct their houses and improving basic community service infrastructure.

Ratings for the Port Au Prince Neighborhood Housing Project are as follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. The assessment offers the following lessons: (i) In the case of catastrophic disasters or in fragile settings, the need to address humanitarian needs and disaster recovery may preclude significant impact on disaster vulnerability reduction. (ii) International NGOs can be effective project implementers in an emergency context where government capacity has been weakened. (iii) Investments in infrastructure can have a larger impact on neighborhood recovery than those from direct housing reconstruction. (iv) Disaster preparedness is critical and requires upfront investment in disaster risk management capacity and in relevant data and analytics, including geospatial data. (v) Projects seeking to support durable responses to crises in FCV countries may need a combination of transitional measures and durable measures targeting vulnerable households. (vi) Pilot efforts may have limited impact if they are not based on a replicable model.

Morocco - Completion and Learning Review for the Period of FY14-FY17 : IEG Review, Web Resource ,"This independent review of the World Bank Group’s Completion and Learning Review (CLR)
covers the period of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), FY14-FY17. In addition to the CLR,
this review is based on the original CPS approved by the Board on April 1, 2014 and the
Performance and Learning Review (PLR) dated May 24,2016 which updated aspects of the
original CPS. Morocco is a lower middle-income country with a GNI per capita of $2,860 in 2017. Steady
economic growth from 2001 to 2013 helped close the income gap with Mediterranean Europe and
reduce poverty from 15.3 percent to 4.8 percent and lower the Gini coefficient from 40.6 to 39.5
over the same period. The well-being of the poorest 40 percent of the population improved in
absolute and relative terms.1 Morocco’s UNDP Human Development Index (HDI) score has been
increasing gradually from 0.53 in 2010 to 0.67 in 2016, when the country’s ranked 123rd out of 188
countries. However, economic growth has slowed. Average annual GDP growth between 2014
and 2017 was only 3.1 percent despite investment exceeding 30 percent of GDP. Major
development challenges have included a high rate of unemployment (around 10 percent),
especially among the young (about 30 percent), and regional income disparities. Macroeconomic
indicators have improved with lower fiscal and current account deficits and the public debt to GDP
ratio stabilized at around 65 percent in 2016. The CPS had three focus areas: (i) promoting competitive and inclusive growth; (ii) building
a green and resilient future; and (iii) strengthening governance and institutions for improved
service delivery to all citizens.

Uzbekistan - Country assistance strategy for the period FY08-FY11 : IEG CPSCR review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2008-2011 Uzbekistan Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and FY 2010 CAS Progress Report (CASPR), which defined the joint strategy of IBRD/IDA and the IFC.  It also evaluates the CAS Completion Report (CASCR).

IEG agrees with some of the lessons drawn in the CASCR. Chief among them is that the differences between the country's and the WBG's approach to economic policies can best be worked out through a substantive and creative dialogue anchored in the need to promote growth and address poverty, unless the WBG wants to limit its areas of influence to those where there is a firm government ownership.  In addition, IEG stresses the need to focus the strategies on a more realistic set of objectives, as well as on the design of a results framework that can actually be monitored and used to guide the implementation of the strategy.  Over-ambitious objectives distract attention from the areas where the WBG can be more effective, while outcome indicators that cannot be monitored help little in letting the team know how much progress is being made and what corrections may be called for.",Country :  Uzbekistan,Content Type : Reports,"November 29, 2011

"Cluster Country Program Evaluation: Mauritius Country Case Study (FY07–15), Enhancing Competitiveness and Private Sector Development", PDF file,"After nearly two decades of strong economic growth, in 2005 the economy was in difficulties. The loss of trade preferences in textiles in 2005, the anticipation of prospective reform to the European Union’s sugar protocol for 2006–10, and higher international oil prices had contributed to a slow-down in growth, rising unemployment and widening fiscal and current account deficits. A new government was elected in 2005 which implemented a series of bold economic reforms (such as the elimination of the export processing zone (EPZ) regime, a progressive liberalization of the foreign trade and investment regime and simplification of labor laws) to redress the macro-economic imbalances and enhance competitiveness to facilitate efficient restructuring of the economy. This was achieved in large measure. Good policies also allowed the government to deal effectively with the global financial crisis of 2008. Following elections in 2010, a new (and fragile) coalition government was elected which emphasized fiscal stimulus and the pace of reforms slowed.

Bank performance is rated highly satisfactory for the Education Reform Project and satisfactory for the Higher Education Project. Borrower performance for both projects is rated satisfactory. Experience with the projects confirms a number of OED lessons: 1) Projects focusing on comprehensive reform can be successful in countries that have capacity and determination. When ministries collaborate effectively and borrower staff are committed to the reform process, projects that involve multiple ministries may be effectively implemented. 2) Comprehensive, complex, and demanding reforms can work well if initiated through respected national institutions, particularly if reform goals are clearly explained to the public. 3) Rigid procurement and disbursement requirements imposed on smaller institutions (such as schools) or individuals who receive grant funds may adversely impact their ability to implement their projects. Special efforts may be required to limit the paperwork and deadline obligations faced by grant recipients. 4) Government delays in paying counterpart funds disrupt important educational activities of individuals.

Honduras - Completion and learning review for the period FY2012-15 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"Honduras is a lower middle-income country facing significant challenges, with more than two thirds of the population living in poverty and five out of ten suffering from extreme poverty (2012). In rural areas, 6 out of 10 households live in extreme poverty. Another major challenge is the high level of crime and violence in Honduras. In 2012, Honduras had the highest homicide rate in the world with 90.4 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, according to UN Office on Drugs and Crime's International Homicide Statistics database. Citizen security has become a major issue in the country. It is estimated that the annual cost of violence accounts for about 10% of the country's GDP (nearly US$ 900 million). When the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was presented to the Board in November 2011, Honduras was still in the process of political reconciliation. The Government of Honduras (GoH) was taking steps towards fiscal consolidation after the 2009 crisis for a better management of public finances, and citizen security became an important national agenda with the persistent high level of crime and violence. These key challenges, as noted in the Completion and Learning Review (CLR), have remained key development constraints throughout the CPS implementation. Crime and violence have also eroded citizensâ confidence in the rule of law. In Honduras, victims of crime are 6.5% more likely to take justice into their own hands when compared to non-crime victims.

In 2015, the economy suffered from an adverse external environment, a summer drought, and a banking crisis, but IMF reports that the economy expanded by 4.1 percent in 2016. After 1999, the country has had a high economic growth and significant progress in reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity, with 4.8 percent growth in consumption among the bottom 40 percent in 2009-14, compared with 1.3 percent for the entire population. The 2016 Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) notes that the national poverty rate shrank from 26 percent in 2007 to 11 percent in 2014. The poverty reduction in Moldova has been driven largely by remittances and pensions. The country ranked 107 out of 188 countries on the 2015 Human Development Index, representing a very modest improvement from 2010. Moldova’s ranking on the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) declined significantly on Control of Corruption (from around 29 in 2011 to 17 in 2015). 

IEG ratings are as follows: development outcome was moderately unsatisfactory, and World Bank Group (WBG) performance was fair. Two main lessons from this review: First, that caution is called for in moving rapidly to focus on budget support and results based operations under circumstances where there is concern about the quality of systems and controls in financial management and procurement. Second, that results frameworks would need to be designed with outcome indicators that clearly measure the achievement of the stated objectives, taking into account country context and WBG interventions.

Jamaica - Economic Stabilization and Foundations for GrowthDevelopment Policy Loan (DPL), Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews the Economic Stabilization and Foundations for Growth Development Policy Loan (DPL), approved on December 12, 2013. 

The objectives of the operation were to improve (i) the investment climate and competitiveness, and (ii) public financial management for sustainable fiscal consolidation. Objectives were highly relevant to country conditions and the need to avoid fiscal insolvency and begin implementing a comprehensive program of stabilization and reform. They were closely aligned with the World Bank’s strategy and government priorities. The design of the operation was substantially relevant to challenges, with policy priorities identified based on significant analytical work and nonlending technical assistance. The theory of change was convincing, with clear links among inputs, outputs, and expected results, although some indicators could have been more outcome oriented and clearer in their relation to objectives. One shortcoming of the design was the ambitious time frame for the implementation of some of the reforms related to investment climate and pensions, given the limited institutional capacity and a realistic assessment of the time needed for major legal reforms. 

Achievement of both objectives is rated substantial. Under the investment climate objective, reforms targeted improvements in contract enforcement, approval of building permits, and registration of micro, small, and medium enterprises to encourage their participation in the formal sector. Under the public financial management and fiscal consolidation objective, the program targeted progress on pension reform, tax reform, civil service reform, cash management, and public investment management. The impact of all reform actions was measured relative to specific indicator targets, which were substantially achieved or exceeded. These achievements were confirmed by additional quantitative indicators, qualitative gauges, and international benchmarking data. Some reforms, such as those in investment climate and pension reform, took longer than originally envisioned, but they proceeded and deepened over time. Cumulative evidence suggests that the reforms supported by the operation have been sustained and, in several areas, deepened during the past six years. This is reflected in the new development policy financing series supported by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund Stand-By Arrangement that followed the successful conclusion of the three-year arrangement under the International Monetary Fund’s Extended Funding Facility.

The sustainability of both pairs of project is rated highly likely, given the fact that most of the projects' design features have been spread to all districts in the country where they are taking root.  Institutional development is rated substantial for both pairs of projects.  Bank and borrower performance are rated highly satisfactory for UPBEP and satisfactory for DPEP, with the difference coming largely in the extent to which project components were fully implemented. Lessons from these projects include: (1) More concerted effort is needed to provide access and better learning outcomes among tribal children and the disabled; (2) The information-based planning and decision making approaches promoted by UPBEP/DPEP are only as good as the data available to them; there is an urgent need for higher levels of quality control in the government's education information and assessment systems; (3) The main constraint to the GOI's reaching its goal of universal primary school completion by 2010 is no longer school access but high student dropout; stronger commitment to dropout reduction and more effective interventions (based on local research on causes) are needed, targeting locations where the problem is particularly serious; (4) There is an urgent need for strategic thinking and decision making concerning the deployment of âpara teachers,â taking into consideration equity issues, cost-effectiveness, sustainability and its long term impact on the teaching profession; (5) There is a need for a clear understanding of the reasons and consequences of the rapid growth of unrecognized private schools, and sharpened government responses;  and (6) Improving student learning outcomes needs more than just setting goals and mobilizing inputs; it needs coherent changes in intermediate outcomes at the classroom level.",Country :  India,Content Type : Reports,"June 30, 2007

An Evaluation of Bank Support for Decentralization in Client Countries (FTB), PDF file,"Developing countries have decentralized functions and responsibilities for service delivery to lower levels of government at an increasing pace in recent years.  The main reasons for such reforms are often political, but governments adopt them also as a way to improve service delivery and local governance.  Typically, after the political decision is made, a country will turn to its development partnersâincluding the World Bankâfor support in implementing the new policies and achieving their development objectives. IEG assessed the effectiveness of Bank support for decentralization between FY90 and FY07 in 20 countries, seeking to inform the design and implementation of future support.  Given the difficulties of measuring the results of decentralization, the evaluation used intermediate outcome indicatorsâsuch as strengthened legal and regulatory frameworks for intergovernmental relations, improved administrative capacity, and increased accountability of subnational governments and functionaries to higher levels of government and to local citizensâto assess the results of Bank support in these 20 cases.  To examine potential lessons at a sectoral level, the evaluation also assessed whether Bank support for decentralization improved intermediate outcomes for service delivery in the education sector in 6 of the 20 countries. Bank support contributed to more effective decentralizationâsubstantially in more than one-third of the 20 cases and modestly in the others.  The most successful aspects of Bank support pertained to the legal frameworks for intergovernmental relations, the frameworks for intergovernmental fiscal transfers, and subnational financial management.  Bank support was less effective in clarifying the roles and responsibilities of different levels of government and in improving own-source revenue mobilization by subnational governments, often due to lack of political will.  Other things equal, Bank support brought better results where there was consensus around the reform within the country prior to Bank engagement and when the support was combined with incentives for institutional reform at the subnational level.  Looking forward, the results of Bank support for decentralization can be strengthened with more timely and coordinated analytical work to underpin it, by better coordinating fragmented sector-by-sector interventions, and by accompanying support for policy reform with technical assistance to strengthen local government capacity.", ,Content Type : Reports,"August 25, 2008

Papua New Guinea - Completion and Learning Review for the Period FY13-FY18 : IEG Review, Web Resource ,"This review covers the period of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), FY13-FY16, and updated in the Performance and Learning Review (PLR) dated July 1, 2016. At the PLR stage, the CPS period was extended by two years. Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a lower middle-income country with a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of $2,340 in 2017. Oil and gas extraction has been the main  driver of economic growth. During the CPS period, GDP growth varied considerably, from 0.3 percent in 2018 to 15 percent in 2014, due to volatility in commodity prices and disruption in the operations of three major mining and petroleum projects from a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in 2018. The country’s Human Development Index increased from 0.52 percent in 2010 to 0.544 in 2017, ranking 153rd among 189 countries in 2017. PNG rejoined the WBG’s Harmonized List of Fragile and conflict affected situation Countries (FCS) in FY17 and FY18. This list had excluded PNG since 2011. The World Bank Group’s (WBG) CPS had three pillars (or focus areas): (i) increased and more gender-equitable access to inclusive physical and financial infrastructure, (ii) gender equitable improvements in lives and livelihoods, and (iii) increasingly prudent management of revenues and benefits. IEG rated the CPS development outcome as moderately unsatisfactory, and the WBG performance as fair. The CLR provides three lessons: First, portfolio improvements require sustained engagement by all project teams, implementing agencies, and the Government, as well as stronger interagency coordination. Second, PNG’s institutional and social fragility places a premium on understanding political economy factors with a bearing on projects, and on monitoring and ensuring awareness of grievance redress mechanisms.

Turkey - Istanbul seismic risk mitigation and emergency preparedness project, Web Resource ,"Turkey faces high vulnerability to earthquakes, with Istanbul posing the most serious risk due its high seismic risk and its role as the population and economic center of Turkey.  A major earthquake near Istanbul in 1999 led to over 17,000 deaths and damage estimated at $US 5-13 billion.  The World Bank supported a post-earthquake reconstruction project over 1999-2006, but vulnerability to earthquakes remained high, especially for Istanbul.  A major earthquake in Istanbul would be catastrophic, and could derail the country’s development trajectory. The government was committed to undertaking disaster risk mitigation, but needed external assistance and support to do so.  The World Bank was a suitable partner based on its financing capacity, technical expertise in disaster risk management and mitigation, and credibility and trust in Turkey based on prior disaster risk management engagements.  These considerations motivated the creation of the Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project (ISMEP) as a proactive risk mitigation effort.

Ratings for the Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project are as follows: Outcome is highly satisfactory, Risk to development outcome is negligible, Bank performance is satisfactory, and Borrower performance is highly satisfactory. The project offers the following lessons: (i) A sub-national multisector model can be highly effective for reducing disaster risk in a well-functioning major metropolitan area, even in a country where these approaches are unusual.  (ii) A semi-autonomous professional project coordination unit can help to ensure effective and efficient project implementation even when dealing with many stakeholders and beneficiary agencies.  (iii) Even highly successful project models may not be replicated if they cannot generate strong government ownership and if they rely on exceptional measures.  (iv) The World Bank can achieve large scale impact by creating effective project platforms that are able to attract additional financing from other institutions. (v) The World Bank can offer significant value to clients from financing, access to technology, project management experience, and influence - even in megacities in high capacity upper middle-income countries.  (vi) Pilot efforts may not support learning if they do not have monitoring and evaluation systems that assess their contribution to program objectives and draw conclusions for the design of future interventions.

Laos People's Democratic Republic - Second Land Titling Project, Web Resource,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews the experience of the Bank in support of the Second Land Titling project in Lao PDR during the period 2003 to 2009. The project objectives consisted of (i) improving land tenure security; (ii) developing transparent and efficient land administration institutions; and (iii) increasing domestic revenues from land-related taxes and fees.  
The project outcome is rated as unsatisfactory. Lessons learned include, (i) government commitment and funding are prerequisites to achieving and sustaining benefits; (ii) transparency of the status of land rights is essential for achieving success; (iii) systematic land titling does not necessarily ensure a significant and sustained increase in tenure security in the absence of efficient enforcement of new land titles; (iv) Bank support for land administration interventions should not be made without full appreciation of the broader political context; (v) it may prove to be more effective to complete policy reforms and regulatory changes before launching a campaign of systematic land titling;  and (vi) increase in land values is not a sufficient indicator of the benefits resulting from a land titling project.", ,Content Type : Reports,"December 2, 2013

Kazakhstan - Completion and Learning Review : IEG Review, Web Resource ,"The Republic of Kazakhstan is a land-locked upper middle-income country with a nominal GNI per capita of $7960 in 2017. The country depends on oil, with production and exports of hydrocarbon accounting for 21 percent of GDP and 62 percent of exports in 2017. Average annual GDP growth declined from 6.5 percent during 2006-2011 to 3.6 percent during the CPS period (2012-17), primarily due to deteriorating oil prices after 2013. The fall in oil prices reduced the growth of non-oil activities and the associated gains in wages and employment. Per capita GDP grew at 2.1 percent during the CPS period and contributed to reduce the poverty headcount ratio at national poverty line from 5.5 to 2.5 percent of the population between 2011 and 2017. Income distribution improved, with the Gini index falling from 0.28 in 2011 to 0.275 in 2017. The Human Development Index improved from 0.765 in 2010 to 0.800 in 2017. Kazakhstan key development challenges and goals set in the Strategy 2030 and Strategy 2050 include strengthening macroeconomic management (including strengthening of non-oil sources of revenues), reducing the state presence in the economy, strengthening regional economics through infrastructure and agricultural value chains, ensuring equal access to high quality education, enhancing social protection, managing natural resources, policy regarding water resources and improving governance and public sector capacity.",Country :  Kazakhstan,Content Type : Reports,"December 2, 2019

North Macedonia - Regional and Local Roads Program Support Project, Web Resource ,"This PPAR assesses the development effectiveness of the Regional and Local Roads Program Support project in North Macedonia, which was approved in 2008. The original development objective of the project, “to reduce cost of access to markets and services for communities served by regional and local roads,” was revised through a level I restructuring in 2013 “to reduce the cost of safe access to markets and services for communities served by regional and local roads in North Macedonia’s territory, and to improve institutional capacity for investment planning and road safety.” The revised objective thus introduced the element of road safety to access, as well as institutional capacity for investment planning and road safety.

Ratings for the Regional and Local Roads Program Support Project are as follows:  Outcome was satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons from the project include: (i) Objective criteria developed and applied in a participatory manner can support a transparent framework to allocate investments and maintenance funds in the roads sector. (ii) The decentralization of responsibilities to local governments needs to be accompanied by the availability of commensurate resources and capacity building. (iii) Road safety and road design elements need to be jointly integrated into the project design and monitoring framework to mitigate risks to the effectiveness of road projects. (iv) Road project appraisal requires sufficient time and technical due diligence to ensure effective and timely project implementation.

"World bank support for revenue policy reform in Eastern Europe and Central Asia : with performance assessment reports of economic and sector work in Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyz Republic", Web Resource ,"This review serves both as an in-depth performance assessment of three pieces of economic and sector work (Georgia 2002 Public Expenditure Review; Kazakhstan Tax Strategy Paper; and Kyrgyz Republic 2000 Fiscal Sustainability Report), and as an overall assessment of recent revenue policy reforms in these three countries. The report focuses on the taxation of non-extractive business sectors and discusses some of the work that the IFC has done on tax administration and policy in the three countries.
The experiences point to some lessons about tax policy. First, tax policy needs to balance various objectives, even if the specific analysis at hand puts most of the focus on only one or two objectives. Second, strengthened tax administration was important not only for implementing the policy reforms, but also because the increased revenue gave the government the fiscal space to take some decisive policy actions. Third, one should consider the whole tax system. Simplifying the structure and lowering the level of rates for the formal sector are beneficial, all else equal, but the treatment of micro and small enterprises is also critical for limiting evasion out of the small-scale end of the tax net.", ,Content Type : Reports,"June 29, 2011

Ukraine : development of state statistics system for monitoring social and economic transformation (devstat) project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses the Development of State Statistics System for Monitoring Social and Economic Transformation (DEVSTAT) project in Ukraine. This project was one of two pilot projects (along with Burkina Faso) supported under the Statistics Capacity Building Program (STATCAP).
DEVSTAT was approved by the World Bank on March 25, 2004. The original closing date of the project, December 31, 2009, was extended three times due to delays in the ratification of the loan agreement, delays in the procurement of advanced information communication technology, and to allow for the national rollout of the integrated
statistical data processing system (ISDPS). The project closed on December 31, 2013.
Total project cost was estimated to be $37.94 million, of which $32 million would be financed by the World Bank and $5.94 million by borrower contributions. Additional Financing of $10 million was granted in December 2012, at which time the statement of objectives was formally revised. The revised objective aligned the statements of
objectives in the loan agreement and the project appraisal document. Actual total cost at project closure was $45.19 million, financed by a loan of $42 million from the World Bank and a contribution of $3.19 million from the borrower.
The objective of this project was “to build a sustainable state statistical system, which would efficiently and effectively collect, process, and disseminate accurate, timely, coherent, and trustworthy statistical data concerning the economy and social conditions of the borrower required by the government, business, and society to make informed decisions, and encompassing a comprehensive reform of the State Statistical System of Ukraine, primarily through the modernization of the State Statistical Committee.”",Country :  Ukraine,Content Type : Reports,"March 30, 2017

Honduras - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2007-10 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2007-2010 Honduras Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the FY 2008 CAS Progress Report (CASPR), the FY 2011 Interim Strategy Note (ISN), and evaluates the Country Assistance Completion Report (CASCR).

IEG's review of the results of the Bank's program concludes that it is imperative that an effective dialogue with the government be maintained, building on recent progress. In Honduras there are major issues which have long been prime constraints to sustainable development yet have never been addressed effectively. They include, in particular, the fiscal burden of the public sector (especially teachers) wage bill and of energy sector subsidies, the lack of a professional civil service which, among others, impedes implementation of development programs, and the poor quality of education, which limits employment opportunities and thus also contributes to the growth of gangs and crime. In addition, IEG's review concludes that CASPRs and ISNs are the opportunities to adjust the objectives of a strategy to what can realistically be expected when external shocks have a major impact on the strategy's implementation and priorities. While, in the case of Honduras, the Bank was flexible and made an effort to adapt its strategy to changing country circumstances, especially with the ISN, objectives remained ambitious in light of the political economy of the country.",Country :  Honduras,Content Type : Reports,"November 22, 2011

The strategy was joint between IBRD, IFC and MIGA and this review covers the program of the three institutions. IEG rates overall outcome of the WBGÂ´s strategy as moderately unsatisfactory. IEG concurs with the lessons of the CPSCR, and underscores two additional points. First, with political uncertainty and frequent changes in governments, the timely use of the CPSPR to update the objectives of the strategy and adapt them to the new political environment appears essentialâjust as the CPSPR was used to adapt the World Bank Group (WBG) strategy to the global financial crisis, another exogenous development. For instance, several aspects of the approach to energy in the WBG strategy appeared to have lost the necessary political backing and objectives could have been revised. Second, the WBG could align its strategy more closely with that of the country, to avoid weak ownership from becoming an obstacle to effectiveness. This appears to have been the case with the emphasis on the efficiency of service delivery, which was differed from Ukraine's focus on the quality of the services.

Ghana: Country Assistance Review, Web Resource,"The study reviews the design and implementation of the country assistance strategies presented to the Board in 1995 and 1997. The overall outcome of the program is rated satisfactory, balancing successes in reducing poverty and improving social indicators against shortfalls in governance, reducing the role of the state, uneven macroeconomic management, and shortfalls in governance
and private sector development. Sustainability is rated as uncertain, since growth and poverty reduction have depended on large inflows of concessional aid, and improved environment for private sector development depends on improved governance, sound macroeconomic management, and deeper reform of the state sector. Against this background, the International Development Association's overall impact on institutional development is rated as modest. Future assistance strategy for Ghana will be within the Comprehensive Development Framework. This implies a stronger focus on improved economic management, public finance, and governance, as well as participation of civil society and private sector development, with the International Finance Corporation and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency playing substantial roles.

Romania - Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project under the Global Program for Avian Influenza (GPAI), Web Resource ,"This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Romania Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project under the Global Program for Avian Influenza (GPAI) Control. 
Prior to 2007, prospects of Romania's European Union (EU) accession put considerable pressure for application of EU standards in implementation of laws and strategies as well as in responding to or demonstrating preparedness for emergencies.  The original objectives of the project were to upgrade capacity to manage avian influenza and other zoonoses, and prepare for influenza pandemics and infectious disease emergencies in humans.  There was already substantial capacity in Romania to respond to avian influenza emergencies, but there was some scope to improve capacity in the animal health surveillance, diagnostic, and other systems. 
IEG rates the overall project outcome as Unsatisfactory.  Following a waning of interest in project activities on the Government side after EU accession and lack of project performance, the project was restructured and the animal health component was eliminated from the objectives which made it less relevant for reducing the threat posed from avian influenza. The main lesson identified by this project is that countries that have already effectively controlled avian influenza outbreaks in poultry may not need an emergency project, but rather long-term capacity building. The evaluation also notes that interventions that target only the human health sector will miss the most effective way of reducing the Avian Influenza risk to humans.",Country :  Romania,Content Type : Reports,"June 24, 2013

Albania - Health System Modernization Project and Social Sector Reform Development Policy Loan Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report assesses the Albania Health System Modernization Project (HSMP), implemented from 2006 to 2012, and the Albania Social Sector Reform Development Policy Loan, a one-tranche DPL that became effective in August 2011 and closed in April 2012. The HSMP development objective was (i) to improve physical and financial access to, and use of high-quality primary health care services; (ii) to enhance capacity for formulating and implementing health sector reforms and policies; and (iii) to improve hospital governance and management. The HSMP's overall outcome is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The Social Sector DPL was designed to support legislative reform (i) in support of social safety net effectiveness; and (ii) in support of health spending efficiency and equity. The DPL's overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Both projects were (a) grounded in analytic work and technical assistance; (b) supported far-reaching reforms; (c) sought to exploit synergies across various forms of Bank support and lending instruments; and (d) faced a range of challenges inherent in reform implementation. Highlights of cross-cutting lessons follow. (i) The high quality of the Bank's analytic work and technical assistance is necessary but not sufficient for effectiveness. Also important are the involvement and buy-in of government and other key stakeholders, as well as the strategic packaging of this support with other products and services. (ii) One-tranche development policy lending can be transformative and support reform momentum, if it (a) builds on solid analytic work; (b) can effectively leverage critical policy change that may not gain sufficient traction through sector dialogue alone; and (c) is supported by continuity in the sector policy dialogue and through lending services once the DPL closes. (iii) The political economy is critical to factor into reform design and risk management. Neglect of some aspects in this regard is likely to have undermined prospects for the full and successful implementation of health reforms under the Health Sector Modernization Project. (iv) The sequencing of reforms under the subsequent Social Assistance DPL and its implementation support is likely to have mitigated potential implementation setbacks associated with political feasibility, capacity, and fiscal constraints. (v) The design and implementation of pilot projects to test and fine-tune reforms, the establishment of well-functioning management information systems and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems are critical to health and social assistance reform, as these can accommodate learning, provide evidence of the feasibility and benefits of such reform, and garner political support.

Mozambique - Public Sector Reform Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report assesses the Mozambique Public Sector Reform Project (2003 to 2009). A two-phased approach was envisaged for this project that sought to restructure the public service to improve decentralized service delivery, and to improve governance. Initially, a high level of commitment for public sector reform existed, evidenced by an ambitious government strategy that also aligned with the Bank's country strategy and other donors' programs. However, the design proved to be overambitious in relation to the low capacity environment, particularly when high level commitment for the reforms started to flag. While the project was restructured and its time span extended, the addition of new components, expansion of the monitoring framework, and addition of new implementing partners added to the project's complexity, which was not appropriate given the severe capacity constraints and the reduced political commitment. The overall outcome is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Lesssons from this operation include, (i) Public sector reform operations need to consider sustainability of leadership commitment. Political commitment is multi-dimensional comprising several elements, such as clear enabling policies, time-bound implementation strategies, adequate resourcing, and inclusive citizen participation. (ii) The reform program's ambition must fit the country's capacity and technical assistance needs. In the case of Mozambique, part of the program was well designed to focus on quick wins that would visibly generate public support, help sustain commitment, and can help motivate service providers. However, the legal reform element was overly complex and lacked adequate technical assistance to keep it on track. (iii) In contexts where there is joint donor support, the Bank should aim to also provide its support through this fund. Using the same processes for accessing funding from the Bank as for other funding reduces transaction costs for government, and helps ensure that the Bank's resources are disbursed without delay. (iv) Both leadership commitment and capacity have implications for Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). In situations of low commitment and capacity, the Bank needs to spend extra effort to select and link measurable indicators to objectives, and obtain baseline data at the outset. M&E needs to be owned by project managers to support real-time adjustment to projects through the use of feedback mechanisms, and to ensure that results are broadly understood, and used to widen support for reform.

There are four lessons: 1) Biodiversity conservation cannot be carried out in isolation. It has to be integrated within the economic interests of local and regional communities. Resentment is created when financing of nature conservation appears to have preference over unmet local needs, be it employment or delivery of basic services. Failure to integrate local interests in the conservation and management strategy of a biosphere reserve can endanger its longer-term sustainability. 2) Conservation areas will be sustainable only if there is good management and sufficient funding. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) project designers must help establish sound management and governance arrangements that include local stakeholders and promote income-generating activities. 3) When establishing biodiversity reserves, facilitate networking of the reserve staff with the national and international nongovernmental organizations and promote recognition by international conventions. 4) The GEF should move towards a country-focused strategic approach to complement its thematically-driven development framework.

Azerbaijan - Petroleum Technical Assistance Project, Web Resource ,"This evaluation found that the project's poor quality at entry, combined with the shift of the government's focus to undeveloped fields, caused the project to gradually lose momentum and undermined the achievement of its objectives. Many activities were never completed, including major ones such as the development of petroleum legislation and exploration promotion. At the end, about 50 percent of the credit amount was canceled, and of the amount disbursed, about half was for activities that were not part of the project's original scope. Accordingly, the outcome of the project is rated unsatisfactory and its sustainability is non-evaluable. While the project contributed to strengthening State Oil Company's (SOCAR's) institutional capacity, the extent of the contribution was limited given the size of the SOCAR operation, and institutional development impact is thus rated as modest. The Bank's performance during lending and implementation phases is rated unsatisfactory and the borrower's performance is also rated unsatisfactory on balance. Some of the key lessons from this evaluation are: (1) Under country and sector conditions like those in Azerbaijan, the design of the project should have been simpler, to include only a few high impact components and substantial ""real time"" interventions by the Bank in response to the borrower's needs. (2) The need to include major legislative action as a policy condition needs to be carefully considered based on borrower ownership and capacity.

Philippines - Social Welfare and Development Reform Project, Web Resource ,"This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the World Bank Group on the Social Welfare and Development Reform Project (including additional financing) in the Philippines. The project had two objectives: (i) strengthen the effectiveness of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) to efficiently implement the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (the CCT program, known as Pantawid); and (ii) strengthen the effectiveness of the DSWD to expand an efficient and functional National Household Targeting System of social protection programs.

Results for this Social Welfare and Development Reform Project are as follows: Outcome was highly satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons from the project include: (i) The success of a large, nationwide social protection program like Pantawid lies in creating and strengthening the operational and institutional systems needed to support it. (ii) Strong government ownership is critical to establishing and sustaining ambitious programs like Pantawid. (iii) The World Bank’s ability to bring global knowledge to bear and skillfully deploy a full technical engagement was key to success. (iv) Continuous monitoring and evaluation are essential to maintaining CCT programs like Pantawid and ensuring their constant evolution. (v) The quality of education and health, not just service utilization, is critical to achieve the expected gains in human capital. (vi) As for all CCTs, a graduation strategy is essential to ensure that the program delivers on longer-term benefits and acts as a stepping stone into more stable livelihoods.

Slovenia - Real Estate Registration Modernization Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews the experience and lessons of the Real Estate Registration and Modernization Project (RERMP) in Slovenia. The project was approved in June 1999 and closed six years later and as scheduled in June 2005. Actual project costs amounted to EURO 25 million ($31.2 million) compared with the appraisal estimate of EURO 27 million ($28.7 million). The project received a Bank Loan of EURO 14.1 million ($15.0 million equivalent). At project closure, the Loan had been drawn down by EURO 12.9 million. The EU contributed EURO 3.0 million to the project for technical assistance and computer equipment. Government's counterpart financing was EURO 9.1 million.
The project's objective was to: Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of real estate administration systems in Slovenia, including improvement of the real estate registration system; upgrading the legal framework for real estate transactions; establishment of an agricultural land use monitoring system to meet European Union accession requirements; and designing and testing of a market-based property tax and valuation system.
RERMP's Outcome was satisfactory overall, although implementation confronted a number of difficulties, RERMP's's objectives were relevant, the project broadly met its objectives, and its facilitating role in an expanding land market indicates its economic viability. Risks to Development Outcome were rated moderate, and the performances of the Bank and borrower were satisfactory.",Country :  Slovenia,Content Type : Reports,"June 23, 2010

"Experience with Institutionalizing Monitoring and Evaluation Systems In Five Latin American Countries: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica and Uruguay", PDF file,"This paper presents a comparative analysis of the ways in which Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica and Uruguay have sought to institutionalize government-wide monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems. The analysis focuses on government-wide M&E initiatives only. These five countries have structured their M&E functions in a variety of ways. In Colombia, Costa Rica, and Uruguay, the functions are concentrated in one single system. These systems are known, respectively, as the ""Public Management Results Evaluation System"" (SINERGIA), the ""National Evaluation System"" (SINE), and the ""Results-Based Management Evaluation System"" (SEV). Among the many lessons are the strong advantages of having high-level support, and the benefits of coordination among different stakeholders and systems.

The diagnosis concludes that it is a well-performing system. The main challenge it now faces is its full institutionalization, so it will continue to thrive and support good governance after any future change in administration. This will require a strengthening of both the demand and supply sides of M&E. On the supply side, it will entail further improvements to the quality and credibility of monitoring information, a reduction in the costs of data supply, and an increase in the volume and breadth of evaluations which are conducted.

Romania - Railway Rehabilitation Project, Web Resource ,"The audit largely concurs with the Implementation Completion Report ratings of the Romania Railway Rehabilitation Project, i.e., on a highly satisfactory project outcome, highly likely sustainability, and high institutional development impacts; and, while it also concurs with the highly satisfactory Borrower performance, the audit upgrades the Bank performance from satisfactory to highly satisfactory. Some insights, rather than lessons are offered from the success experience of this operation. It is first emphasized that policy changes are more likely to be implemented successfully when Bank support is provided right at the time when public entities have committed to the process of commercialization, and, supportive sector-wide reforms are being put in place. However, whenever railway companies are moving toward commercial operations, their long-term financial health needs to be assured by rationalizing subsidy support, and introducing an appropriate costing model. In addition, a critical success factor in a complex task, such as the installation of an integrated management system, is that sufficient technical supervision and support must be available to assist with problem solving as may arise. Further lessons point at maximizing the benefits of a complex information system, which require that middle and upper level management foresee, and understand the benefits of using the system; and, at the Public Service Obligation Subsidy, which should be for specific services that the Government considers socially necessary; such services should be transparent, explicitly defined, and fully compensated as part of a Contract Plan.",Country :  Romania,Content Type : Reports,"June 21, 2005

Bulgaria : district heating project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) prepared by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluates the development effectiveness and sustainability of results of the World Bank–financed District Heating Project in Bulgaria (2003–08). The project development objectives were to improve the quality of district heating services in the capital city of Sofia (1.6 million people) and an adjacent town of Pernik (86,200 people), improve financial viability of the Sofia and Pernik district heating companies, and increase environmentally friendly operations in the district heating sector, through energy conservation and pollution reduction mechanisms. The project also extended funds from the World Bank–administered Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) for the purchase of carbon emission reductions resulting from the project activities. 

Ratings for District Heating Project were as follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. IEG’s review of this project’s experience in Bulgaria suggests the following lessons: (i) Postponing an energy efficiency project until the necessary legal measures addressing demand-side management are implemented can lead to better outcomes. (ii) Sustainability of benefits from infrastructure investments can be put at risk if future investment needs are unmet. (iii) Investments in energy efficiency infrastructure alone are not enough to achieve sustained financial viability. (iv) Efforts to encourage private sector participation may fail when there is no strong agreement from key stakeholders in the context of a complex and changing governance structure. (v) Carbon finance operation or results-based financing can have strong demonstration effects.

Armenia - municipal water project, Web Resource ,"Armenia enjoys abundant water resources averaging 10.2 billion m3 per year, of which 2.4 billion are used for drinking water. Drinking water is provided by five state water companies1. Demands on water production are high because of excessive levels of non-revenue water (NRW) of up to 85 percent. In 2012, at the time of the appraisal of the Municipal Water Project (MWP), Armenia had recorded significant legislative and institutional achievements in terms of water resources management in cooperation with international institutions, including the World Bank. The water sector reforms were aimed at decentralizing the water resources management function for the benefit of water users and best use of water resources. However, water tariffs have been low since 20092 and revenues insufficient for asset rehabilitation to reduce NRW. The MWP’s project development objective (PDO) was to support improvement of the quality and availability of the water supply in selected areas of the Armenia Water and Sewerage Company (AWSC)—a state water company owned by the State Committee of Water Economy (SCWE). 

Ratings for the Municipal Water Project are as follows: Outcome is moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome is high, Bank performance is moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance is moderately satisfactory. In terms of lessons, the implementation of the MWP suggests the following: (i) The sustainability of development outcomes is enhanced when the World Bank maintains its strategic and operational engagement over time, especially when social and political risks are high. (ii) The World Bank’s continuous advice and technical assistance, provided in parallel with lending and in coordination with other donors, can result in effective partnership with the government and the private sector. (iii) Tailoring the Enhanced Management Contract to the conditions of the local service area can help achieve results.

The Bank has committed almost US$1 billion for 47 projects in BiH since 1996. In addition to reconstruction, the Bank supported investments and policy reforms in health, education, social protection, infrastructure, and the financial sector, including highly successful lines of credit for SMEs. The outcome of Bank and donor support of BiH's transition to a private sector-led, market-based economy was mixed. The complex structure of the government and its lack of commitment to reform led to limited progress in PSD, particularly the privatization of SOEs.

"The World Bank in Nepal, 2003-2008 (Country Program Evaluation)", PDF file,"This report evaluates International Development Association (IDA) support to Nepal during 2003-2008. IDA's overarching goal during this period was to support the Government's efforts to reduce poverty and improve human well-being. IDA focused on helping to foster broad-based growth, social development, social inclusion, and good governance.
IDA was Nepal's largest development partner, providing 13 percent of (gross) overseas development assistance (ODA) flows during 2003-2008. Bank efforts to strengthen government ownership and leadership in development assistance coordination ran into challenges as Nepal's political situation deteriorated. Nonetheless, the Bank was able to lead or contribute to productive development partnerships.
The evaluation concludes that IDA's strategy during 2003-2008 was relevant to Nepal's development needs, but that its relevance to the more immediate situation was compromised by several factors, including limited ownership of the Bank-supported government reform program, and its lack of realism with respect to political instability. IDA assistance during the review period had positive outcomes in social development and to some extent social inclusion. In contrast, the outcome of IDA support fell short of the Bank's program objectives and outcome targets in broad-based growth and governance. The low overall efficacy of IDA's assistance strategy is explained mainly by its failure to account for the country's specific circumstances.
The evaluation highlights the need to introduce greater realism into the country assistance strategy, and to retain flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances.  It also stresses the need to consult widely and continually with national stakeholders and development partners.  In addition, it points to the importance of making agriculture and rural development central to the program. The evaluation also focuses on the significance of designing and implementing a mechanism to systematically track the impact of the Poverty Alleviation Fund and adjust its design to enhance benefits to the poor.

Kenya - Arid Lands Resource Management Project, Web Resource ,"This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Kenya Arid Lands Resource Management Project (Cr. 27970), for which a credit in the amount of US$22.0 million was approved in December 1995. The project closed on June 30, 2003, after an 18 month extension. An Implementation Completion Report was submitted by the Africa Region on December 30, 2003.The following lessons may be derived from the project. First, the success of the project indicates that, in order to effectively respond to natural disasters such as drought, there are two principal requirements: (a) there needs to be a structure in place at the local level through which the relevant government departments and non-governmental actors can meet speedily to address the situation and coordinate their actions; (b) that body needs to have some resources, not necessarily substantial, to fund initial measures to address the identified problems, so that response is not delayed by the need to obtain resources through normal bureaucratic channels. Second, the statement of project objectives is important. Care should be taken by both the Bank and the Borrower to ensure that the objective statement is clear and does not become blurred by vaguely stated goals. This is especially important when, for example, though the project may be broadly targeted to assist the poor, the nature of its interventions is such that it will be difficult to demonstrate whether it has met a specific poverty objective. Third, in operations like the ALRMP it is important to design, at the outset, performance indicators to track qualitative as well as quantitative progress on achievement of objectives, or to agree at the outset on specific steps to monitor performance in meeting qualitative objectives.",Country :  Kenya,Content Type : Reports,"October 31, 2005

Cambodia: An IEG Country Assistance Evaluation 1999-2006, PDF file,"The World Bank was Cambodia's third largest donor between 1999 and 2006. While objectives have shifted somewhat over time, the Bank's focus in Cambodia has consistently been on four areas of activity. In this country evaluation, IEG rates the outcome of the Bank's support for economic management and poverty reduction as moderately satisfactory; the outcome of the Bank's program of support to education and health sectors as satisfactory; Bank assistance in agriculture, rural development, and natural resource management as moderately unsatisfactory; and Bank involvement in infrastructure as satisfactory. Although progress has been made regarding some governance-related issues, much more is needed; IEG rates the Bank's strategy in this area as unsatisfactory. The overall rating for the Bank's assistance to Cambodia is moderately satisfactory. 
The report recommends that the Bank should remain engaged in areas where reasonable success is being achievedâ in education, health, poverty reduction, rural infrastructure, and public financial management. Because governance problems present a significant obstacle to private investment and potential future growth, the Bank should continue to engage the government on governance issues. Moreover, given the importance of rural development for reducing poverty, and the potential for improving agricultural productivity, the Bank should address weaknesses in its rural strategy. The Bank's lending operations should be more streamlined than in the past and focus on a few key objectives and limited actions to meet these objectives. Finally, the Bank should continue to focus attention on fiduciary safeguards with respect to the IDA portfolio, and formulate a new disclosure policy for its fiduciary investigations.",Country :  Cambodia,Content Type : Reports,"July 1, 2010

The project represents an innovative experience for Jamaica in combining efforts to improve public safety and community capacity while upgrading urban infrastructure. The PPAR findings provide input to a major IEG evaluation on “Building Urban Resilience” (forthcoming, 2019).

Ratings for the Inner City Basic Services for the Poor Project are as follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was substantial, World Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Lessons from the project include: (i) Addressing urban crime and violence through a two-pronged approach of improving basic infrastructure and promoting social inclusion can benefit from the combination of those individual activities that are most effective. (ii) The sharp disconnect between a centralized and well-resourced agency executing infrastructure investments in a decentralized urban situation; and a multiplicity of under-resourced service agencies and local governments in charge of infrastructure maintenance can undermine long-term development outcomes. (iii) In project design, the decision to add activities that are institutionally complex and require focused expertise requires careful consideration to avoid straining resources and effort during project implementation. (iv) To sustain the benefits from community-based and social services for children and youth, long-term engagement is crucial: institutional ownership should be specified, and resources for those activities must be anticipated and secured by the time project support is discontinued.

Timor-Leste - Country assistance strategy (CAS) completion report review for the period FY06-FY11 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the Fiscal Years (FY) 2006-2008 Timor-Leste Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the FY 2010 Timor-Leste Interim Strategy Note (ISN), and assesses the CAS Completion Report (CASCR). This review covers the joint program of the tWorld Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). 

The broad objective of the CAS was to support Timor-Leste in consolidating its early progress and creating the conditions for growth outside the petroleum sector and poverty reduction. The objectives were organized under three pillars: (i) delivering sustainable services; (ii) creating productive employment; and (iii) strengthening governance. Youth and gender would be mainstreamed across these pillars.

IEG rates the overall outcome of the World Bank Group support as moderately unsatisfactory, concurring with the CASCR rating. It is only ten years since Timor-Leste celebrated independence. Although the country is making rapid progress in developing the key political and social structures, IEG concurs with the CASCR that the environment in which the WBG program was delivered was fragile, rapidly changing and in some ways uniquely challenging. 

IEG concurs with the lessons identified in the CASCR, and underscores three additional points. First,the importance  to devote at least as much attention to building a strong results chain for the cross-cutting themes as to any other pillars, and include them in the results framework for proper progress monitoring. Second, the risks tn the successful implementation of WBG program may differ in important ways from the risks facing the country that the WBG program is designed to address. Confusing the two often leads to inadequate mitigation measures to leal with the implementation risks. Third, the results frameworks should be consistent with the institutional capacity for data collection and streamlined to include a manageable number of key outcomes to guide program implementation and help signal any needed adjustments.",Country :  Timor-Leste,Content Type : Reports,"March 5, 2013

Ethiopia Country Assistance Evaluation, PDF file,"This Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) reviews the development framework in Ethiopia, between the period 1992 to 1997, to evaluate the assistance provided. In 1992, the new government adopted an agriculture-led development strategy, intended to avoid the biases against rural areas, as seen in Africa. Strategically, the Government sought to replace the state-controlled economy, with a market economy, and devolve power to constituent states, rather than centralizing it in Addis Ababa. Structural reforms progressed well, with a fast growth in the real gross national product, conducive to likely poverty reductions, and, the Government committed to sector investment programs in education, health, and, roads. However, expectations regarding private sector development, have only been partially fulfilled, while reforms remain to be completed to sustain the development momentum. It is recommended that the Bank should now focus on: the development of multi-year programs, including reforms; a strategy to remove obstacles to private sector development, including faster liberalization of the financial sector; a strategy for promoting institutional development; and, a review on agricultural, and environmental assistance. Overall, assistance strategy should focus on policy reforms, whether or not adjustment credits are considered.",Country :  Ethiopia,Content Type : Reports,"November 30, 2000

Indonesia: Country Assistance Note, PDF file,"Indonesia, with significant Bank support, has achieved major progress, despite the setbacks of the 1997 financial crisis, which exposed the country's structural flaws. However, while the government's development strategy has had remarkably positive results, issues of poor governance, social stress, and a weak financial sector were not addressed and contributed to the depth of the crisis. A conclusion that emerges from the study is that broad-based  development, including social development and structural reform, calls for long-term institutional development. The crisis has provided the opportunity for the Bank to begin tackling some of these issues. A
monitoring mechanism for social, governance, and financial sector issues should be instituted to complement the macroeconomic monitoring of the International Monetary Fund. The Bank should strengthen its risk analysis, which should be undertaken for large borrowers, even when their economies are performing well. This report recommends that the Bank address three issues.

Uganda - Cotton subsector Development Project and Agricultural Research and Training Project, Web Resource ,"The audit largely concurs with the Implementation Completion Report's ratings, of satisfactory project outcome for both projects, and of satisfactory performances by both the Bank and Borrower; yet, it upgrades the Cotton Sub-sector Development (CSSDP) Project's sustainability to highly likely, and institutional development impacts to high; while regarding the Agricultural Research and Training Project's sustainability it considers same not evaluable, but concurs with substantial institutional development impacts. The main lessons from the CSSDP, and of wide general application suggest that despite commodity prices and natural conditions, at times being unfavorable, a dilapidated agricultural industry can re-emerge relatively quickly through a committed government, and appropriate economic and social policies. Moreover, the financial restructuring of a bankrupt processing industry, which in this case facilitated the return of experienced international operators, proved an essential requirement for agricultural rehabilitation. However, it is underlined that Project designs should be fully complete at approval, especially in production-oriented projects where some components are needed to ensure that output objectives can be achieved. Regarding the Agricultural Research Project, lessons suggest that sustaining smallholder production requires a flow of technology from research, particularly public sector research is especially important in a sector dominated by poor subsistence farmers, dependent on food crops. This is justified on public goods and social safety net grounds, and in terms of financial and economic efficiency, given the high returns to agricultural research for rural areas.

Lao - Southern Provinces Rural Electrification Project, Web Resource ,"The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory, because of EdL's unsatisfactory financial performance for most of the project's duration and the technical problems. Bank performance was satisfactory, and that of the borrower moderately satisfactory (again reflecting EdL's poor financial performance). The risk to development outcome is modest since measures implemented toward the end of, and subsequent to, project completion have addressed the financial sustainability issue, and technical issues are being addressed under the follow-on Rural Electrification Project. The main lessons from this review are as follows: (i) the consumers are willing to pay tariffs at cost recovery levels, and the willingness to pay analysis shows that consumers are willing to pay for electricity at levels exceeding supply costs. Lao PDR has been able to implement sizeable tariff increases in a short space of time with no adverse social impact or notable demand reductions (indeed it can be argued that any reduction in usage by already connected customers would help extend supply to new locations); (ii) but poorer households remain unconnected, even after the grid has been in a village for more than 10 years, some 20 percent of households remain unconnected. Smart (i.e. efficiently targeted) connection subsidies for late connectors will help achieve government's 90 percent coverage target; and (iii) explicit attention needs to be paid to technical efficiency, and technical problems of system losses and outages reduce financial performance and undermine project benefits.

The main lessons from the Second Power project concern the importance, prior to Board approval, of addressing procurement policies, and procedures that could create problems, and delays later; the need for a truly independent regulatory regime to govern tariff determination, in order to help safeguard the sector ' s financial viability; and, the importance of rigorously assessing risk, and identifying exit mechanisms for project components, in areas of civil unrest. Conversely, the ESDP yielded the following lessons of broad applicability, as the Bank expands its assistance for renewable energy, as part of its 2001 Energy Business Renewable Strategy, and 2003 Infrastructure Plan. These lessons can be clustered around three important areas: a) building-up the business and policy environment, addressing in particular the key barrier of access to capital; b) scaling-up the market, including a reliable after-sales service system, and end-user training; and, c) establishing strong project, and financial management systems, including monitoring and evaluation.",Country :  Sri Lanka,Content Type : Reports,"June 25, 2004

Zimbabwe - Second Structural Adjustment Credit Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Prformance Assessment Report (PPAR) downgrades
the Evaluation Summary outcome rating, from marginally satisfactory to highly unsatisfactory, institutional development from modest to negligible, sustainability from uncertain to highly unlikely, borrower performance from unsatisfactory to highly unsatisfactory, and, Bank performance from satisfactory to unsatisfactory. These ratings result from the fact that the objectives of restoring macroeconomic stability, improving public sector management, and shielding the poor from the transitional impact of adjustment, were not met. As for institutional development impacts, the project targeted reforms in the parastatal sector, where results were disappointing. Furthermore, the 1998-2000 period has been one of macroeconomic destabilization, with slippages in structural reforms, and forcible land acquisition, which has destroyed private sector confidence, and the core of efficient agriculture. Although the Bank correctly focused on liberalizing the economy, constraining parastatal losses, and on agricultural marketing reforms, it overestimated Government ownership of this project ' s reforms, and underestimated the risk to stabilization, and to private sector confidence. In addition, early analytic work to assist in public expenditure management was not planned, and the social impact of reforms not monitored. Regrettably, the Borrower, following 1997, reversed many of the reforms already implemented under the project. Lessons suggest a public expenditure review should have been undertaken early on; political dialogue and consensus built, rather than relying on commitments; and, tranche releases should be based on results, taking into account that poverty reduction is paramount in adjustment operations, particularly in low-income countries.",Country :  Zimbabwe,Content Type : Reports,"February 24, 2003

Brazil : integrated solid waste management and carbon finance project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses the development effectiveness of the Integrated Solid Waste & Carbon Finance Project in Brazil. The project was approved on November 2, 2010, for a cost of US$160 million, with World Bank support of US$50 million. The project cost at completion was US$122.7 million, with only US$16.7 million of the World Bank’s loan being utilized. The project was closed on December 31, 2015 as planned. The objective of the project was to improve the treatment and disposal of municipal solid waste in Brazil. This was to be achieved through closing of open dumps and constructing modern and environmentally safe landfills, improving municipal solid waste management (SWM) practices, reducing poverty among waste pickers, increasing private sector participation in SWM service provision, and strengthening the borrower and implementing agency CAIXA Econômica Federale’s capacity to manage carbon finance projects.

Ratings for Integrated Solid Waste Management and Carbon Finance Project were as follows: Outcome was unsatisfactory, Risk to development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Lessons from the project include: (i) A project with sector-wide objectives must provide for engagement with the government at the policy level to lay a strong basis for achieving development outcomes. (ii) For an operation involving a financial intermediary, a minimum number of sub-projects must be committed at project effectiveness, to demonstrate quick successes and to develop further momentum during implementation. (iii) In an upper middle-income country with broad-based financial and institutional resources, the World Bank’s interventions in a sector should focus on functional areas with a clear need and demand for external support and expertise. (iv) In seeking to attract private sector investment and expertise to public service provision, the major barriers to entry must be clearly recognized and addressed. Incentives at the margin are unlikely to generate wide or sustained interest.

"Thailand - Finance Companies Restructuring Loan, Economic and Financial Adjustment Loan, and, Second Economic and Financial Adjustment Loan Projects", Web Resource ,"The main findings from the review of these loans suggest: given that the significant cost of cleansing financial crises can offset progress made over the years in poverty alleviation, and other social improvements, the Bank should continue to play a role in both improving financial sector governance, and soundness to reduce the probability of crisis, as well as in post-crisis management and well-structured recovery. Early underestimates of the severity of the crisis, and the impact of the closure of the finance companies (FCs) on the economy, raised concerns about the credibility of the international financial institutions' approach, and, most important to Thailand's future, about the financial reform itself. This suggests that crises in other countries need to be approached more comprehensively, taking into account potential negative impacts of large scale closures. The audit stipulates short-term crisis management policies can compromise essential structural reforms. The failure to factor in the design of the reforms the inadequacies of the Thai legal, and regulatory infrastructure led to approaches that may have increased the cost of cleanup. Further lessons highlight that sequencing and timing of reforms are crucial; and recommend that succeeding loans with increasingly broader goals, and a growing list of conditions, diffused the focus of reform and meaningful monitoring. A better approach might have been a well-designed programmatic loan, as now being used (but not available at that time), which seeks to develop a set of priority reforms, and sequences the steps for supporting those reforms through successive loans.",Country :  Thailand,Content Type : Reports,"January 31, 2006

The context of the period under review though, was dominated by the consequences of the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12, 2010 causing unprecedented loss of life and physical capital. The main challenges were reducing vulnerability to disasters, reconstructing infrastructure, developing human capital-especially primary education and maternal and child health, and promoting private sector development. The WBG program set interventions and outcomes consistent with the scope of the government's crisis response program and its longer term priorities. The CAS--designed for FY09-FY12--formally ended six months early, in December 2011, owing to the shift in priorities as a result of the earthquake. The Bank was quick to respond to the earthquake with technical advice, timely adjustments to the Bank program, a damage assessment, and additional commitments for recovery and reconstruction. The ISNs (CY12, FY12-FY13) that followed the CAS appropriately gave priority to emergency response to the earthquake and reconstruction, and kept as longer term priorities issues related to human capital, business environment, and institutional development, continuing with work already started under the FY09-FY12 CAS.

The Bank's CPS consisted of three pillars. Pillar one, promoting good governance and public sector capacity strengthened management of public resources at central and local levels and public administration regulatory and oversight role. Pillar two was improving competitiveness and the investment climate for private sector-led growth, through improved business climate and improved access to and quality of key economic infrastructure services. Pillar three was strengthening human capital and social inclusion through better positioning of the education and technical and vocational education and training sectors to meet the needs of the labor market and improved targeting of public expenditures and specific programs. The CPSCR draws a number of lessons to be heeded in the next CPS. These lessons include: (a) the results matrix needs to be aligned only with outcomes of projects in the portfolio, and not with outcomes dependent on external factors; (b) the Bank can assist Cape Verde in facilitating South-South exchanges on sector reforms and on the provision of guidance to low-income countries; and (c) stronger institutional capacity building will be necessary to strengthen the sector ministries, particularly in the collection, evaluation, and dissemination of the data needed to monitor projects and programs. IEG finds that the value of a candid assessment of risk to development outcomes during the implementation status report and CPSPR processes can enable mid-course correction and provide more solid ground to assess the likelihood and sustainability of achievements.

At the start of the new millennium, malnutrition in Senegal was of great concern. Malnutrition contributes to child and maternal mortality and morbidity, undermines children’s prospects of reaching their physical and intellectual potential, and undercuts income-earning potential for households and overall productivity and economic development. Its two principal causes are inadequate food intake and illness. Underlying factors are poverty; inadequate access to quality food; inadequate knowledge and behaviors favoring the health of mothers and children; and inadequate services, especially health, clean water, and sanitation. In 2001, the government of Senegal issued a new nutrition policy, supporting a 10-year goal to improve nutrition through a community-based, multisectoral approach. The policy was translated into the 10-year Nutrition Enhancement Program (NEP), financed by the government of Senegal, the World Bank, and eventually others.

This is the first WBG CPS for Iraq following three Interim Strategy Notes (ISNs). At the Performance and Learning Review (PLR) in May 2015, the CPS was extended by one year to FY 17, to accommodate a shift in WBG’s strategic focus in response to the security and economic crisis and to support the government in macroeconomic stabilization and reconstruction. IEG concurs with the following CLR lessons: (i) need for flexibility and timely responses in FCV context; (ii) use of innovative approaches to implement and monitor in fragile environment; (iii) effective service delivery to renew social contract between citizens and state. IEG adds the following lessons: (i) Significant strategic shifts in country engagement would need to be reflected not only in lending and ASA programs but also in the results framework. (ii) There is significant scope for effective IFC and MIGA engagement in a middle-income-country even in the presence of conflict. (iii) In an environment of sustained fragility and conflict, the DPF instrument is best anchored on a solid partnership with the Government and other development partners to manage risks and raise the odds of success.",Country :  Iraq,Content Type : Reports,"December 6, 2017

"Ghana: agriculture development policy operations, phase I – IV", Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses the outcome and sustainability of two consecutive World Bank–financed programmatic series of DPOs in the agriculture sector in Ghana with a total disbursement of US$ 157 million. Objectives of these two projects include: (i) to increase the contribution of agriculture to growth and poverty reduction; (ii) to improve the management of soil and water resources; (iii) to enhance productivity and market access among farmers; and (ii) to improve agriculture sector management. Ratings for the First Agriculture Development Policy Operation Series were as follows: outcome was moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant, World Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. These ratings differ from the ICR in all four areas. Ratings for the Second Agriculture Development Policy Operation Series were: outcome was moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant, World Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. All ratings except for risk to development are different from the ICR. Lessons include: (i) In a sector such as agriculture, in which responsibilities are fragmented across many different directorates and agencies, impact could be heightened by broadening engagement beyond key counterparts in the leading ministry to other directorates charged with delivering program results. (ii) Rigorous assessment of government commitment and ownership is needed not only at the design stage but throughout implementation. (iii) Potential synergies between sector and general budget support operations could be enhanced by more effective coordination and monitoring and feedback between the two. (iv) Defining DPO series objectives in concrete and measurable terms and scaling ambition down to what the actions in the operations can realistically be expected to influence can improve the demonstration of impact and enhance attribution.",Country :  Ghana,Content Type : Reports,"March 6, 2017

World Bank Group Support for Domestic Revenue Mobilization (Approach Paper), PDF file,"Effective domestic revenue mobilization (DRM) is essential for developing countries’ abilities to finance their development goals in a sustainable and equitable manner. DRM—the generation of government revenues from domestic activities (World Bank and IMF 2015)—is relevant to at least 2 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This evaluation focuses on the World Bank Group’s support to its clients to improve central government DRM, which includes revenue from tax (VAT, direct taxes, excises and customs) and nontax collections (including royalties from extractives). Recently, DRM has faced challenges aggravated by the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the attendant collapse of economic activity in many countries. The pandemic is expected to affect many aspects of DRM, including tax payments and tax compliance. This evaluation aims to assess the relevance, effectiveness, and coherence of Bank Group–supported strategies and interventions over FY16–19 to help clients improve DRM, as well as assess the extent to which the World Bank identified the distributional implications of its support to DRM in country interventions.

Georgia - Completion and learning review for the period FY14-FY17 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review of the Georgia Completion and Learning Report of the World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covers the CPS period, FY14-FY17, including the CPS Performance and Learning Review (PLR) of April 2017. Georgia is a lower-middle-income country with a GDP per capita of 3,866 dollars (2016).Its economy grew on average by 3.5 percent annually during the review period higher than the 1.9 percent average for the ECA region—with persistently large external current account deficits in the 12-13 percent of GDP range financed mostly by foreign direct investments. The CPS corresponded well with the government's stated development objectives set out in the Socioeconomic Development Strategy 2020, which had as overarching aim to achieve faster, inclusive, and sustainable growth averaging 7 percent annually. The WBG's country program pursued two strategic objectives or focus areas of strengthening public service delivery to promote inclusive growth and enabling private-sector-led job creation through improved competitiveness. The areas selected were congruent with the country's development goals, and in sectors where it had shown capacity to deliver in the past. IEG adds the following lesson: Competitiveness and labor market issues are key binding constraints for Georgia's growth, and areas in which the Bank has comparative advantage. Yet, the Bank failed to address them adequately and effectively under this CPS. To maximize development effectiveness, the Bank should not miss opportunities to address effectively areas which are both significant binding constraints for country growth and in the domain of the Bank's comparative advantage.",Country :  Georgia,Content Type : Reports,"May 10, 2018

Brazil Country Assistance Evaluation (Reach), PDF file,"During the 1990s Brazil was able to stabilize its economy and articulate a clear development agenda. Poverty rates declined, especially due to success with stabilization. Social indicators improved significantly, especially in the poor regions of the country. There was less success in restoring high growth rates, partly because the critical social security and financial reforms started late in the decade and have not gone far enough. Lingering regulatory deficiencies have also constrained growth. The Bank's assistance program is rated satisfactory overall, as it placed appropriately a great emphasis on poverty alleviation and made an important contribution to the improvement in social indicators in the 1990s, especially in the poor Northeast. The Bank can still play a relevant role in Brazil, helping the Government consolidate and deepen the gains in social indicators and remove the obstacles to a stronger growth performance.",Country :  Brazil,Content Type : Reports,"March 16, 2004

Bhutan - Strengthening Regional Cooperation for Wildlife Protection in Asia: Phase II of the Adaptable Program Loan, Web Resource ,"South Asia is home to 13–15 percent of the Earth’s floral and faunal biodiversity, including some of its most iconic and endangered wildlife species, such as tigers, snow leopards, one-horn rhinoceroses, elephants, pangolins, and brown bears, all of which are on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species (2017). Among the South Asian countries, Bhutan has a high density and an extraordinary range of species (more than 5,000 vascular plants, 600 birds, and nearly 200 mammals). This biodiversity is extremely important to the patrimony of Bhutan and to the economy and well-being of its people. At project appraisal in 2011, the South Asian region was facing several threats to its wildlife, including rapid loss of critical natural habitats, increasing poaching of wildlife, and expanding illegal trade in wildlife and wildlife products driven largely by consumer demand in East Asia. The project’s objective was “to assist the Recipient in building and/or enhancing shared capacity, institutions, knowledge, and incentives to tackle illegal wildlife trade and other selected regional conservation threats to habitats in border areas.

Ratings for the project are as follows: Outcome was satisfactory, Risk to development was moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. IEG’s review of the project’s experience suggests the following lessons: (i) Robust upstream work that builds strong and sustained commitment by all governments participating in a regional approach to wildlife protection is a necessary condition for success. (ii) Projects involving multicountry collaboration on global public goods are challenging to design and implement, making the provision of adequate preparation time critical for conducting necessary analyses of participating country commitments and capacities. (iii) Projects piloting new approaches to multicountry collaboration on transboundary wildlife management present challenges that require a carefully designed results framework to measure and track progress in achieving project objectives. (iv) Projects designed to build national institutions and capacity for multicountry collaboration on transboundary wildlife management require a long-term investment to ensure successful outcomes.", ,Content Type : Reports,"December 13, 2018

Concept Note For an IEG Complex Learning Product on Environmental and Social Risk Mitigation in DPOs, PDF file,"Development policy lending differs markedly from investment lending. The two instruments diverge in terms of what is supported by the loan, how development impact is intended to be achieved, the mechanism for disbursement of funds, and many of the specific requirements that govern the design and implementation of operations. Those requirements include approaches to addressing potential environmental and social effects. Development policy lending is governed by a separate Bank Operational Policy (OP 8.60),1 which describes it as ""rapidly disbursing policy-based financing, which the Bank provides in the form of loans or grants to help a borrower address actual or anticipated development financing requirements that have domestic or external origins."" The World Bank internal processing of Development Policy Operations (DPOs) also differs from that of Investment Project Financing (IPF).

Tunisia Country Program Evaluation FY2005 to FY2013, PDF file,"From FY2005 to FY2013, the World Bank Group program in Tunisia aimed to support government in: (i) strengthening the business environment, improving competitiveness, and increasing the global integration of the Tunisian economy; (ii) improving skills and employability of its citizens; (iii) promoting social and economic inclusion; and, particularly since 2011, (iv) improving voice, transparency, and accountability. Since 2011, the International Finance Corporation has taken a more active role in Tunisia, complementing Bank efforts. The nature and type of Bank Group-client relationship during the period under evaluation greatly impacted the relevance, design, and success of the strategy. Between FY2005 and FY2010, the Bank Group's work in Tunisia was mediated through its relationship with the Ben Ali regime, which despite its shortcomings was highly regarded by the international community because of Tunisia's relatively positive economic and social development. That relationship was broadly characterized by tight government control and, particularly after 2007, relative passivity on the part of the Bank. The government mediated the Bank's interaction with stakeholders, prevented dissemination of some economic and sector work (ESW), and blocked some key work for example, public expenditure review (PER) and investment climate assessment (ICA) which impacted the Bank's reputation as a provider of independent analysis, notwithstanding the quality of analytical and advisory activities (AAA) actually produced. After 2007, the Bank chose to not challenge or make public its increasing concerns about governance issues or its policy divergence with the government on a number of critical reforms, notably in relation to the financial and private sectors that were pervaded by rent-seeking behaviors. Yet the Bank continued to set ambitious objectives in these sectors knowing that the lack of government buy-in to first-order reforms would undermine the achievement of relevant Bank Group objectives. Project design was often flawed because critical bottlenecks identified in ESW were not addressed many of the operations delivered change that was necessary but insufficient to accomplish Bank Group objectives without supporting reforms to remove core obstacles (for example, the dichotomy of the onshore-offshore regime and regulatory issues in the financial sector). Early in the period, the Bank flagged risks associated with domestic political turmoil, but that critical risk was not referenced in the country partnership strategy (CPS FY2010 to 2013) that was terminated in January 2011 as a result of the revolution. The Bank's reticence may have been intended to keep business lines and dialogue open with a regime that had little need of Bank assistance, having attained investment grade status in 2007, but at a reputational cost. Overall, the outcome of the Bank program prior to 2011 is judged unsatisfactory. The Independent Evaluation Group proposes a number of sequentially ordered recommendations to strengthen ongoing Bank Group efforts in Tunisia. First, the risk assessment exercise for the forthcoming CPS could usefully develop scenarios that take account of volatility in the political economy and allow for flexibility of response should risks materialize. Second, until the political situation stabilizes, the Bank could focus its efforts on galvanizing public support for reforms. For example, it could use the rich analysis of the 2013 development policy review (DPR) to help inform and build capacity among a broad base of stakeholders, such as trades unions, think tanks, civil society organizations (CSOs), and Parliament, to raise awareness and gradually build ownership of the reform agenda. Taking account of capacity and other constraints, the Bank Group could prioritize and sequence first-order policy reforms (that is, investment code, competition law, and labor market rigidities) while building government ownership and capacity on how to roll out the reform agenda.

Kenya - Agricultural Productivity Program (KAPP I and II), Web Resource ,"This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) covers the Kenya Agricultural Productivity Program (KAPP) and Kenya Agricultural Productivity and Agribusiness Program (KAPAP). This report was commissioned to assess the development results and outcomes of the projects, and to document the experiences and lessons from the innovative institutional and policy reforms carried out to accelerate agricultural productivity growth and commercialization of smallholder agriculture in Kenya. The sequential implementation of two projects offered an opportunity to assess the extent to which certain institutional and policy reforms—to bring pluralism in the agricultural extension system and increase the performance of the agricultural research system—have contributed to crop-livestock productivity growth. It also allows evaluation of whether the changes introduced are likely to be sustained.

This report covers two projects and ratings for each are as follows: Kenya Agricultural Productivity Project - Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was high, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Kenya Agricultural Productivity and Agribusiness Project – Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. The following lessons are drawn from the experience of the KAPP program: (i) Sustained government ownership and commitment are key to achieve complex and sectorwide institutional reforms. (ii) Effectiveness of institutional reforms and project outcomes requires sustained effort through continuous realignment with the changing context. (iii) Participatory and client-driven approaches with strong priority setting and regular evaluation are critical to stimulate and transform the agricultural research system. (iv) Provision of agricultural extension services to poor small-scale farmers as a public good requires a sustainable financing mechanism. (v) Public sector funding for extension services can be decoupled from public provision to strengthen complementarities and create space for private sector participation and improved service delivery. (vi) Scaling up the contracted service delivery model using the privatized extension system requires development of new public regulatory and quality control systems.

Jamaica - Country partnership strategy progress report for the period of FY 2010-2013 : IEG CPSCR review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the FY2010-FY2013 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and FY2010-FY2013 CPS Progress Report (CPSPR), and assesses the CPS Completion Report (CPSCR). The CPS was jointly implemented by IBRD and IFC and covers the programs of both institutions. The CPS (FY2010-2013) was aligned with Jamaica's Vision 2030 and strategic priorities articulated in its first Medium Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework. It was organized around three strategic pillars: (i) Supporting Economic Stability, (ii) Promoting Inclusive Growth, and (iii) Promoting Sustained Growth. Strengthening Governance was highlighted as a key crosscutting issue. IEG rates the Overall Outcome as Moderately Satisfactory. Of the three outcomes sought under pillar (i), one was achieved (abolishing deferred financing), one was mostly achieved (debt management), and one was partially achieved (preparing consolidated public accounts). Progress was made in most areas in achieving outcomes under pillar (ii). Eight outcomes, not all of equal importance and weight, were sought, of which four relatively simpler targets were achieved (persons trained in crime prevention, increase in crime data collection, inner city infrastructure and financial services, risk management training), three were mostly achieved (decentralized education, registration of childhood institutions, children benefiting from cash transfers), and one was not achieved (support for medium-size farmers). Pillar (iii) had partial accomplishments and several shortcomings. There were nine outcomes sought under this pillar, of which two were achieved (capacity to plan for climate resilience, public expenditure planning), four were partially achieved (landslide risks, internal audit, external audits, prioritization of public project), and three were not achieved (reducing energy losses, ease of paying taxes, weather risk). The CPS had identified many areas for IFC interventions but the IFC was unable to develop successful operations in most of these areas. Where successful, such as, in air transportation, IFC's program was cohesive with a series of privatization projects with good coordination between investment and advisory projects. However, in most areas such deliberate progress was missing. For example, in electricity, while generation capacity has been improving, almost no gains have been made to address systems loss, energy efficiency, and sustainability of sector institutions. Similarly, very little progress has been made to increase the number of schools through a public-private-partnership (PPP), as was envisaged in the CPS to eliminate the shift system in schools. IEG is in agreement with the key lessons identified in the CPSCR with respect to the need to improve competitiveness, desirability for flexibility, the need for realism in an environment of fiscal and capacity constraints, and for an efficient monitoring system. Other lessons that can be drawn from the CPSCR, some of which are quite important are: (i) Attention to financial and institutional constraints and external shocks is essential to setting realistic outcomes and achieving sustainable results; (ii) Careful consideration of sequencing and timing of reforms that deal with structural changes and capacity constraints is key to achieving expected outcomes; (iii) Using programmatic policy-based lending in support of difficult and demanding reforms in crisis situations proved to be a prudent approach; (iv) Identified weaknesses in investment lending projects suggest that simplification of project design is critical to achieving expected outcomes without implementation delays; and (v) Close collaboration with other development partners in Jamaica has proven important in achieving greater impact.

The evaluations found that Bank assistance to the financial sector, both in lending and nonlending, has contributed to the development of the financial sectors in client countries. The FSAP advanced dialogue with client governments and provided useful advice and recommendations. Lending has helped to bring about positive changes in governance, regulatory framework, market structure, and efficiency. Overall, and with the important exception of Bank support for LOC, the Bank's presence has helped to catalyze changes in the right direction in the depth and access to credit of financial systems. Nevertheless, financial sectors remain shallow, with narrow access to credit, in many, if not most Bank client countries, and there is room for improvement in the quality and impact of Bank assistance.", ,Content Type : Reports,"May 18, 2006

It evaluates the extent to which the APL series achieved its intended outcomes and offers an opportunity to draw lessons from the long-term engagement of the World Bank in reform of the Armenia health sector aiming to inform and guide future investments in the health sector. The APL series was selected for an indepth field-based assessment due to its potential for learning from long-term engagement of the World Bank in health sector reforms; its clustering nature that allows coverage of multiple lending operation in the same country; and the relatively low coverage of previous IEG project evaluations in the country.

Ratings for the Health System Modernization Project I are as follows: Outcome was satisfactory,  Risk to development outcome was negligible to low, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Project II ratings are as follows: Outcome was satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons from both projects include: (i) An approach that exploits synergies and lessons from other World Bank engagements in the health sector is important for undertaking complex reforms and helping the government stay the course of the reform. (ii) Macro and micro health policies need to be combined in a manner that the unintended consequences of policy changes are not overlooked. (iii) A shortened period between the approval dates of successive phases of an APL can limit the opportunity to incorporate lessons from previous phases into the design of new ones. (iv) In country contexts with strong social and cultural factors affecting uptake of health care services, supply-side and systemwide policy reforms need to be combined with demand-side interventions addressing the health-seeking behavior of patients. (v) While investments in infrastructure are not enough for health system modernization, they can help ensure acceptance of the proposed organizational changes involving strong stakeholders in the hospital sector.

Pacific Islands - Completion and learning review for regional partnership framework for the period FY11-FY17 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This is a summary of six CLR reviews covering the World Bank Group (WBG) programs for
the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) of Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Samoa, Tonga, and
Tuvalu. The summary is based on IEG’s individual country assessments of the completion and
learning reviews prepared for each country. During the period under review, each country prepared a
stand-alone Country Assistance/Partnership Strategy (CAS/CPS), in contrast to previous
engagements that were done under an umbrella regional strategy for the Pacific Islands. Except for
Tuvalu’s country program, all CPSs were joint programs between the Bank and IFC. The
assessments are based on the original CPSs, since no Performance and Learning Reviews (PLRs)
were undertaken for any of the countries.

These countries have populations ranging from 10,000 (Tuvalu) to over 200,000 (Samoa)—
Tuvalu is the smallest WBG member country. They are among the most remote and geographically
dispersed countries in the world, and range from low middle income (Kiribati, US$3,390 GNI per
capita in current dollars) to upper middle income (Tuvalu, US$6,120 GNI per capita in current
dollars). Some of them joined the WBG as recently as 2010 (Tuvalu).

The high cost of operating in these small, remote countries, and limited resources from IDA,
constrained the World Bank Group to engage with them at the regional level or through multi-country
platforms until 2008, when the governments of Australia and New Zealand decided to enter into
funding partnerships with the WBG. These partnerships—combined with significant increases in IDA disaster risk management and climate change—gave the WBG the capacity to operate at scale in the
Pacific Island Countries.

Ethiopia Country Assistance Evaluation (FTB), PDF file,"This is a Fast Track Brief for Ethiopia Country Assistance Evaluation. IEG's evaluation finds that International Development Association's (IDA) country strategy for Ethiopia and the associated program during the period under review were relevant to the country's development needs, which included the need to manage (and over time reduce the country's exposure to) frequent exogenous shocks and a fragile socio-political environment, especially following the post-election violence in 2005. IDA's strategy and program were also aligned with those of other development partners. There were positive outcomes inter alia in post-conflict rehabilitation, economic growth, roads development, education and health. In contrast, the outcomes were less favorable in the key areas of private sector development and governance, which are crucial to sustaining growth over the longer-term and ensuring that its benefits are widely shared.
Going forward, IEG recommends that IDA: (i) tighten the link between the quality of the policy dialogue and resource transfers in support of particular reform areas; (ii) take a clear and consistent position on governance, including binding governance-related constraints on private sector development and hence on prospects for sustaining pro-poor economic growth; (iii) improve its knowledge base on how social, political and cultural factors can influence the effectiveness of its support, notably at the local level; and (iv) extend and deepen partnerships with non-traditional in-country stakeholders.",Country :  Ethiopia,Content Type : Reports,"March 17, 2008

Mozambique Country Program Evaluation, PDF file,"During the period FY01-08, the World Bank was Mozambique's largest development partner, providing over $1.3 billion in International Development Association (IDA) funds. The Bank's strategy, which was aligned with and sought to support the government's poverty reduction strategy, focused on three pillars: economic growth, including macroeconomic management, financial and private sector development, rural development, and infrastructure; poverty reduction and human development; and governance. The evaluation finds that the Bank's strategy for Mozambique and its program were relevant to the country's development needs. The Bank's program was generally aligned with those of other development partners that provide general budget support, especially after FY05. Harmonization of procedures with other development partners also progressed, although there is scope for further improvement. The Bank's program was substantially effective in supporting macroeconomic management, infrastructure development, access to education and health care, urban water, and some areas of governance (such as budget management and execution). However, the program fell short of its intended results with respect to the inclusiveness of growth, stimulating private sector development, improving agricultural productivity, achieving better quality of social services, countering the perception of increasing corruption, improvements in the judiciary system, and stemming the spread of HIV/AIDS. Going forward, IEG recommends that the Bank help Mozambique sustain high growth and reshape its pattern to make additional gains in poverty reduction; give priority in analytic work to infrastructure, agricultural productivity, education quality, and HIV/AIDS; and support improvements in the efficiency of public expenditures.",Country :  Mozambique,Content Type : Reports,"March 15, 2011

Ukraine - Danube Delta Biodiversity Project, Web Resource ,"The audit provides mixed ratings, for while it downgrades the project outcome to moderately satisfactory and sustainability to unlikely, it concurs with the Implementation Completion Report ratings of substantial institutional development impacts, and satisfactory performance by the Bank, despite downgrading the Borrower's performance to unsatisfactory. The experience from this project confirms a number of OED lessons as follows. Biodiversity conservation cannot be carried out in isolation, but integrated within the economic interests of local and regional communities, for resentment occurs when financing of nature conservation appears to have preference over unmet local needs, be it delivery of basic services or employment. Thus, failure to integrate local interests in the conservation and management strategy of a biosphere reserve can endanger its longer-term sustainability. To this end, it is indicated that conservation areas will be sustainable only through good management and sufficient funding to maintain it. Thus it is incumbent upon the Global Environment Facility (GEF) project designers to facilitate sound management, and governance arrangements that include local stakeholders, and promote income-generating activities that will provide sustainable income for management. Moreover, biodiversity conservation may require trade-offs, particularly on the size of the restricted area in which all economic and human activities are banned. Too large an area creates very high overheads on inspections and regulation compliance, and possibly, strong local opposition may undermine longer-term sustainability. The size of the area depends on the conservation objectives: there should be sufficient funding and time to facilitate agreement on the species and/or landscape that are the targets of conservation, and for research to determine required minimum viable habitats/landscapes and their connectivity to larger-scale ecosystems. Finally, upon the establishment of biodiversity reserves it is important to promote networking of the reserve staff with national and international NGOs, and promote recognition by international conventions.",Country :  Ukraine,Content Type : Reports,"June 20, 2005

Lithuania - Klaipeda Environmental Project and Siauliai Environmental Project, Web Resource ,"The outcome of the Klaipeda project is rated as satisfactory. The outcome of Siauliai is rated as moderately satisfactory. Relevance of both projects was high given the need to clean up the Baltic Sea, Lithuania ' s drive for EU accession and harmonization with EU environmental standards, and dwindling public resources to subsidize inefficient utilities. The efficiency of both projects is rated modest. The financial rate of return is borderline for both projects (under 9 percent for Klaipeda and under 7 percent for Siauliai). However, the economic rate of return is likely to be higher if the environmental and tourism benefits could be monetized and included. OED rates sustainability as likely for both projects because of high stakeholder ownership linked to EU accession - but politicization of water tariffs means that financial sustainability at Siauliai will be difficult to achieve in the short term. Bank and borrower performance are rated satisfactory. There are three lessons from this experience: 1) Regionally sponsored environmental initiatives in response to inter-governmental action plans provide good opportunities for the Bank to exercise its comparative advantage in leveraging institutional reform through targeted lending. When linked with grant funding from bilateral development partners it provides a powerful and influential lobby for reform. 2) When extending loans for water supply and wastewater treatment to new client countries or sectors, the Bank could usefully start with minimal or emergency investments linked to an institutional development package that could be the start for a phased investment program. The more recently introduced Adaptable Program Loan would have been an ideal initial lending instrument in this case as it would have allowed time to develop refined criteria and arguments to facilitate Government agreement to more appropriate infrastructure designs and investments. 3) In water supply projects a combination of master meters and in-house meters is more effective at enabling revenue collection than in-house meters alone.",Country :  Lithuania,Content Type : Reports,"June 23, 2003

Ghana - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2008-12 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the FY2008-FY2012 Ghana Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of FY2007 and CAS Progress Report (CASPR) of FY2010, and assesses the CAS Completion Report (CASCR). The CAS was presented as an IDA-only strategy, and this review covers only the program of the World Bank.
The CAS was anchored in the Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy (G-JAS) that was endorsed by 16 development partners. Its overarching objectives were to support Ghana to sustain economic growth of at least 6 percent per year, surpass the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of halving poverty to 26 percent during the CAS period, and start to reduce inequalities. As the G-JAS, the CAS adopted the three pillars of Ghana's second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II); however, there was no clear indication of the specific CAS objectives under each pillar--they were expected to be aligned with the relevant GPRS II objectives, but it was not clear whether they would maintain the same scope and time horizon for attainment of these objectives. The CASPR reaffirmed the overall objectives of the CAS; but in its attempt to be aligned with the new Government's Medium-Term Development Plan, which was evolving and expected to be revised, there was even less clarity on what specific objectives the CAS aimed to achieve during the CAS period.
IEG rates the overall outcome of the CAS as moderately unsatisfactory, below the CASCR rating of moderately satisfactory. Although some progress was made in all areas under the three pillars, none of the objectives was fully achieved, and in more than half of the cases progress fell considerably short of expectations. The Bank's support contributed to Ghana's good progress in enhancing mining sector revenue management, in improving agriculture productivity, in expanding information, communications and technology (ICT) services, and in strengthening the health insurance system. However, progress was slow and fragmented in all the other areas: macroeconomic management was erratic; improvement in the road network was too slow to remove persistent travel bottlenecks; although procedures to start a business were streamlined, the overall business environment did not improve appreciably while access to credit remained difficult; although household electrification improved, distribution losses increased and the finances of the electricity sector remained precarious; while land title registration procedures were simplified, improvement in land administration was hampered by partial progress in required legal and institutional reforms; although child health care delivery and prevention improved, this had not translated into lower infant and maternal mortality rates; participation in primary education increased, but education quality and learning achievement remained low; although access to safe water improved overall, the situation appeared to have worsened in peri-urban areas while access to improved sanitation lagged seriously behind;  while there was consensus on the need for better targeting and a common targeting system was officially adopted, it was yet to be applied for social programs; poor incentive framework and monitoring capacities resulted in continuous degradation of natural resources; and finally, most of the Bank support for decentralization, public sector reforms, statistical capacity building, and mainstreaming social accountability mechanisms was relatively recent, with limited evidence for concrete results.
IEG concurs with lessons drawn in the CASCR, and underscores two additional points. First, policy lending operations ensure alignment and client ownership of the Bank's program, but carry the risk of exposing the Bank's program to the client's political and administrative constraints. To mitigate this risk, they need to be accompanied by a strong program of capacity building to ensure smooth implementation. Second, a good results framework depends on a clear articulation of the CAS objectives to be achieved during the strategy period, as well as a strong results chain linking the Bank's interventions to the CAS objectives and to  the higher-level country goals. Without these, the relevance of the indicators cannot be properly assessed, nor can the achievement of the CAS program.",Country :  Ghana,Content Type : Reports,"August 29, 2013

Brazil - Ecosystem Restoration of Riparian Forests in Sao Paulo Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews the development effectiveness of the Ecosystem Restoration of Riparian Forests in Sao Paulo Project covering the period 2005 through 2011.The review also informed the December 2013 Brazil Country Program Evaluation, FY2004-2011. The objectives of the Global Environment Facility (GEF)-financed project were to arrest and reverse land degradation processes in riparian ecosystems and adjacent agro-ecosystems by increasing on-the-ground investments and strengthening the policy, regulatory, economic, and institutional incentive framework to encourage sustainable land management.The project's overall outcome is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Several lessons can be drawn, (i) In land or forest management projects that aim to induce a change in land use practices and scaling up, it is important to gain an understanding of the motives that various landholders have in order for them to adopt and maintain such practices, as well as technical dimensions of restoration. In this case, the project documented some comparative evidence on the cost and effectiveness of alternative riparian forest restoration technologies that may be of use to future restoration efforts.There was less attention given to the incentives or disincentives that different land owners have to adopt and sustain such practices, or, to overcoming barriers to participation which is equally important for scaling up. (b) Consistency between the objectives, the scale of investments. and associated indicators is essential to avoid incongruities between investment strategy and project intent. (c) Working through multiple institutional players can enhance policy and operational outcomes, but it requires that mechanisms are developed to formalize institutional partnership with clearly defined common targets and timetables to reduce delays. Such mechanisms need to be agreed among all partners upfront. (d) Early consensus on coordination of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) between institutions and sectors within government is crucial in order to ensure alignment of objectives and targets. This is particularly important for projects with an experimental focus and widely dispersed activities that can make data collection, storage and usage more of a challenge.

Nigeria - Second National Fadama Development Project, Web Resource ,"This is the Project Performance Assessment Report of the Second Fadama Development Project (Fadama II) implemented between 2004 and 2009. The second in a series of three consecutive rural development projects, Fadama II represented a significant shift in the way the World Bank framed its approach to service delivery and income generation in rural Nigeria. It was the first project to introduce the concept of community driven development to Nigeria's agriculture sector. Fadama II had three separate but mutually reinforcing objectives, (i) to sustainably increase the incomes of Fadama users--those who depend directly or indirectly on Fadama resources (farmers, pastoralists, fishers, hunters, gatherers, and service providers); (ii) empower communities to take charge of their own development agenda; and (iii) reduce conflict between Fadama users. The community driven development approach project design was substantially relevant. A demand-driven approach was designed to foster cooperation between resource users to more effectively match rural service delivery with identified core local needs. It was also designed to be socially inclusive. The project design would have been more relevant had it been poverty-targeted. Design also lacked an adequate diagnostic of the income constraints of the more marginalized groups included in the project. Conflict lacked a clear definition and a theory of attribution. The project made substantial progress on achieving its first objective of sustainably increasing the incomes of Fadama users. While data made available from external assessment lacks validity, IEG validated the project assumption that sustained assets could generate additional income that could be saved and reinvested over time. Efforts to empower communities to take charge of their own local development were less successful and are therefore rated Modest. Support made available to Fadama II villages was limited to one project cycle. The project was successful in supporting 95 percent of all community associations formed under the project to implement their local development plans. But the empowerment related indicators used by the project were inadequate to measure the project's empowerment effects. To better understand the contribution that the project may have had on empowering local communities, IEG administered a survey to 118 randomly selected beneficiaries in the six states selected for the evaluation. The survey revealed that Fadama was perceived to yield additional welfare benefits and to have increased savings, but benefits were enjoyed more by group leaders and active members than non-active members. Fadama increased female participation in local economic development planning but evidence suggests that women and other members of vulnerable and marginalized groups were often not able to afford or obtain their needed assets. Efforts to reduce conflict between Fadama user groups are rated Substantial. While IEG cannot validate the pronounced reduction in conflict due to the different benchmarks, definitions, and data collection methods used throughout the life of the project, IEG found that there was substantial attention to resource related disputes that took place within the confines of the project. The efficiency of the project is rated Modest owing to a lack of methodological rigor in determining the estimated rates of returns at project end, inefficient targeting owing to purposive selection of the states and local governments, and inefficient use of monitoring, data collection and assessment systems to support implementation and the design of subsequent project phases. The outcome of Fadama II is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Lessons learned include, (i) Technical interventions that transform land related assets require a socially and culturally sensitive project design that--to the extent possible--provides inclusive development opportunities to all affected parties. The Fadama program is illustrative of the risks that are attendant in neglecting social analysis in technical work streams. The project's first phase contributed to conflict between natural resource users groups by financing activities that expanded livelihood benefits to one user group at the expense of others. (ii) Community based approaches to local development require sustained and phased commitment. None of the Fadama villages visited by IEG demonstrated a present day capacity to participate in local development planning in a socially inclusive and accountable manner, despite the projectâs efforts. Fadama II villages were only supported by one project cycle. Villagers interviewed for this review expressed a significant level of disappointment about the lack of continued access to facilitated negotiation for the provisions of local goods and services. (iii) The sustainability of community-based initiatives depends crucially on an enabling institutional environment, which requires government commitment, and on accountability of leaders to their community to avoid ""supply-driven demand-driven"" development. (iv) Programs designed to change behavior need to be grounded in a deep understanding of context; they need to be willing to engage in a study of what motivates people. Programs implemented at scale should include a sensitive design that takes into account the different cultural, linguistic and ethnic characteristics of the targeted population. Programs designed to change behavior also require observational and qualitative indicators that in turn, require capacity building and implementation support to tweak project assumptions and project adjust design in real time.

Tunisia - Natural Resources Management Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses the development effectiveness of the Tunisia Natural Resources Management Project (1997-2004) and the Northwest Mountains and Forest Areas Project (2002-2009). Both projects has similar objectives, (i) to ensure sustainable management of natural resources; (ii) to improve agricultural productivity and increase non-farm income-generating activities; (iii) to construct basic rural infrastructure, such as combining construction of soil and water conservation works; and (iii) to use an integrated participatory approach (IDP) to facilitate greater engagement of local communities in the local development planning process through support for the preparation of community development plans. For both projects, Achievements of project objectives were modest due to limited or lack of outcome level evidence.  For both projects, the overall development outcome of is rated moderately unsatisfactory. 
The experience of the two projects yields the following lessons, (i) weaknesses in the structures that are used to integrate communities into the development process can undermine securing genuine collaboration of communities over the long term. The current forms of organization available to communities in Tunisia have a number of limitations that hamper their utility as a vehicle to formally represent the interests of the community as a whole. It is important that community organizations have sufficient legal standing to ensure their legitimacy in representing the communities' priorities to government agencies, that communities view the leaders of such organizations as legitimate, and that all segments of the population are represented; (ii) demonstrating the effectiveness of natural resource management interventions requires attention to monitoring and evaluation of actual outcomes. Despite three decades of World Bank support to integrated rural development projects with significant investments in soil and water conservation works, no assessment has been made to determine the actual impacts of these interventions on erosion, soil fertility, groundwater recharge, or dam siltation. To date reporting of natural resources management achievements has been based on assumed impacts. Measuring actual results is not only important for understanding whether the intended development impact has been achieved, but also for assessing the cost effectiveness of the measures supported as well as generating information on what needs to be improved; (iii) effective promotion of income-generating projects requires more than support for production. Attention to markets and ensuring the availability of credit is also crucial. Under both projects support for alternative income-generating projects was limited to training and technical support for production side issues. The projects had limited success in establishing successful income-generating enterprises. Many of the training participants were unable to access existing sources of credit. Income-generating activities were also hampered by a lack of market studies.",Country :  Tunisia,Content Type : Reports,"November 6, 2013

"Philippines : support for basic education reform, 2006-2012", Web Resource ,"The Philippines is a lower-middle-income country with a gross national income of $3,550 per capita and an estimated population of 101.6 million in 2015. Economic growth has increased substantially in recent years. The longest period of sustained economic growth in recent history was between 2012 and 2016. Despite this growth, poverty and inequality remain high and persistent. Priority for reform of the education sector has shifted through the years from access to quality. This assessment examines two such education quality projects in the mid-2000s, assessing both projects together because they were designed jointly to support the government’s education strategy. The National Program Support for Basic Education’s (NPSBE) objective was “to improve quality and equity in learning outcomes for all Filipinos in basic education.” The Support for Basic Education Sector Reform Project’s (SPHERE) objective was “to support the implementation of the Philippine government’s Basic Education Sector Reform Agenda (BESRA) which in turn aims to contribute to the achievement of the Philippines’ basic education goal of improving quality and equity in learning outcomes.” 

Relevance of the objectives is rated substantial for both projects. The projects’ objectives aligned well with government and World Bank strategy at appraisal and closing. However, project documents also reference intended efficiency outcomes that were not specified as part of the formal objectives. Relevance of design is rated modest for both projects. Both projects’ stated development objectives supported improvements in quality and equity of learning outcomes, yet the equity objective was not well defined, and the components and activities were oriented toward access and quality with an unclear theory of change that would have related project interventions to equity outcomes.

The Quality of Growth: Fiscal Policies for Better Results, PDF file,"Strong global growth and better economic policies in recent years have substantially reduced poverty in many developing countries. However, with the recent financial crisis originated in the United States, the world economy has entered a period of severe downturn and turbulence. Policymakers around the world face the challenge of restoring the pace of growth and improving its quality. This concern over growth is reflected in the changing incidence of poverty, rising inequality in numerous countries, and widening environmental degradation during the past decade. Unless these issues are confronted, gains from growth are likely to be undermined and the pace of growth, itself, will not be sustained. 
This paper synthesizes results from empirical studies linking three vital aspects of the quality aspects of growth - poverty, distribution, and the environment â with the composition of public expenditures and taxes. We take ""quality of growth"" to mean the type of economic expansion that especially reduces extreme poverty, narrows structural inequalities, protects the environment, -- and in turn sustains growth itself. The background studies confirm that government spending on public goods is broadly associated with both higher and better growth. More spending on public goods including basic education, health, R&D and infrastructure at the margin is generally associated with accelerated growth, reduced poverty, and improved air quality. But to do so without raising overall government spending and triggering macroeconomic instability, the additional spending on public goods needs to be accommodated by a reallocation of government spending away from subsidies for private goods that in the process comprise incentives for excessive resource depletion.  These findings would seem to be timely for the current debate on the role of  fiscal policies in coping with the current economic downturn.", ,Content Type : Reports,"August 5, 2008

"Tunisia - Agricultural Research and Extension Project, Agricultural Research and Sector Investment Project, Northwest Mountainous Areas Development Project, and National Rural Finance Project", Web Resource ,"The project outcome of the Agricultural Research and Extension Project is rated as unsatisfactory, and sustainability is unlikely. Bank performance is rated unsatisfactory because a firmer line should have been taken on administrative restructuring. Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory because of substantial delays during implementation. OED rates the outcome of the Agricultural Sector Investment Project as moderately satisfactory and sustainability is likely. Bank performance is rated satisfactory, reflecting the solid analytic underpinnings of the project and the generally adequate nature of supervision. Borrower performance is rated satisfactory, primarily because of the high commitment to the project. OED rates the outcome of the Northwest Mountainous Area Development Project as satisfactory and sustainability is rated likely because the participatory approach has built community ownership. The National Rural Finance Project ' s outcome is rated highly unsatisfactory because it failed to improve on the deficient approach and mixed performance of the projects that preceded it. Sustainability is rated unlikely based primarily on the weak loan recovery rate. Bank performance is rated highly unsatisfactory because of the design deficiencies (reflected in hurried preparation). Borrower performance is also rated highly unsatisfactory, reflecting on the government ' s failure to allow the National Agriculture Bank to function as a solvent commercial enterprise. Four important lessons were confirmed by this project experience: First, a piecemeal approach to reform-trying to effect small changes under the cover of a number of investment operations-offers little leverage and is therefore unlikely to work. Second, attempts to strengthen monitoring are futile if the performance indicators monitored are not linked to achieving significant outcomes. Third, decentralization is an important objective, but may be counterproductive if resources are spread too thinly. This is a particularly important issue for agricultural services, the structure of which needs to be rationalized. Fourth, where there have been several interventions which are cumulative in effect it is reasonable for evaluators to have higher expectations of development effectiveness and to be correspondingly more demanding in their search for evidence of effectiveness.",Country :  Tunisia,Content Type : Reports,"June 26, 2003

"Mexico - Irrigation and Drainage Sector, On-Farm and Minor Irrigation Networks Improvement, and Agricultural Productivity Improvement Projects", Web Resource ,"The audit gives mixed results regarding the three projects, for although it concurs with the Implementation Completion Report's (ICR) ratings for the On-Farm and Minor Irrigation Networks Improvement Project of a satisfactory project outcome, likely sustainability, and substantial institutional development impacts, concerning the Irrigation and Drainage Sector Project the audit downgrades its project outcome to satisfactory, and sustainability to likely, but concurs on substantial institutional development impacts; and, regarding the Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project, the audit also downgrades its project outcome to unsatisfactory, sustainability to unlikely, and institutional development impacts to negligible. The assessment confirms the following OED lessons of broader relevance. Projects need to dovetail with programs; but well-designed projects can rarely turn around a poorly-designed program. This is a particularly important lesson for the Bank's work in Mexico where leverage is limited. Mexico has ample access to alternative sources of funding, private as well as public. In line with the Bank's poverty reduction mandate, its resources should be tightly targeted, rather than added to programs where there is a high potential for subsidies to be captured by better-off groups. The Bank's leverage may be substantially diluted when project funds flow into a multi-state program which state governments have considerable influence over the use to which resources are put. Large Programs are candidates for formal impact evaluation. In this case, the main limitation of the Alianza evaluation was the absence of a control group of non-beneficiaries, a striking oversight given the level of funding committed. The evaluation should have sampled those who did not apply to the program; and those who did but were rejected. (It is not clear that a list of the rejected is maintained.) Without this control it is impossible to assess claims about the program's leverage: much of the investment (and the income growth attributed to it) might have occurred without a subsidy. Subsidies may have leaked to better-off groups who don't need them.",Country :  Mexico,Content Type : Reports,"July 22, 2005

Azerbaijan - Internally Displaced Persons Economic Development Project, Web Resource ,"The well-being of internally displaced persons (IDPs) arose as a significant political and policy concern in the wake of the military conflict between Azerbaijan and neighboring Armenia. The conflict lasted from 1988 to 1994 when a cease-fire was declared (which continues to this day). The conflict resulted in the occupation of about 20 percent of Azerbaijan’s territory. Some 612,000 people, or 15 percent of the Azerbaijani population, became internally displaced, making them one of the highest concentrations of IDPs per capita in the world. In addition, some 200,000 ethnic Azerbaijani returned to Azerbaijan from historically Azerbaijan-populated territories in Armenia. IDPs live in scattered communities throughout Azerbaijan; and although some have been able to integrate into mainstream Azerbaijani society, many still live in collective centers (public buildings, dormitories) and temporary shelters where conditions are harsh and amenities, such as access to clean water, adequate sanitation, and electricity are scarcer than among the non-IDP population. IDPs have few income-generating options and are highly dependent on state transfers and subsidies as their main source of income. This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) evaluates the performance of the Azerbaijan Internally Displaced Persons Economic Development Support Project, a community development fund project, and an additional financing that was added to the IDP-EDS to respond to additional demand for micro-projects.

Ratings for the Internally Displaced Persons Economic Development Project are as follows: Outcome is moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome is low, Bank performance is moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance is moderately satisfactory. The main lessons to draw from the project assessment are the following: (i) Community micro-projects may not require high levels of community mobilization to be successful. (ii) Well-targeted micro-projects are likely to successfully improve basic living conditions in a community but may not be sufficient to make a difference in terms of creating economic opportunity and reducing poverty. (iii) Pursuing social integration can be a legitimate project objective, but it may require participatory processes that can generate positive spillover effects in the broader community. (iv) When World Bank and government objectives don’t coincide, project outcomes may not be easily achieved and investments can be at risk. (v) Women may be formally present in community committees but may not have a voice.

IEG rated the overall project outcome as moderately satisfactory. While the responsiveness of the Bank to the request for support from the Government for the drought emergency is commendable, Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory, due to the design weaknesses, lack of follow-up on the quick disbursing component during supervision, inadequate reflection of implementation difficulties in Implementation Status and Results (ISR) ratings and failure to notice a safeguard violation.

The IMF and the World Bank agreed to support comprehensive debt service relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to allow public resources to be redirected to poverty-reduction programs, while the reduced debt overhang served to boost investor confidence. The core of PRSC operations have been public sector reforms dealing with government financial and personnel management, including: legal establishment of the single treasury account principle; creation of this account in the Ministry of Finance registries; creation of an integrated System for Financial Management and Auditing; and creation of a civil service system and incorporation of all government workers into the system.

Albania: Country Assistance Evaluation, PDF file,"This Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) covers a period from 1992 to 1997 of IDA (International Development Association) involvement with the Government of Albania, and its development efforts. The evaluation reviews twenty two projects, a substantial economic, and sector work (ESW) program, and an active policy dialogue, to present a synthesis of findings on a comprehensive, and intense country assistance program. The CAE ' s main conclusion is that IDA ' s assistance to Albania was effective, and the partnership forged with the Government scored some notable successes. The breakdown in civil order in 1997, and subsequent destruction of property was a major setback to the development progress achieved thus far. Nonetheless, good progress was attained in agriculture, external debt management, small and medium scale privatization, tax reform, and price and trade liberalization, which has indeed endured. However, there were weaknesses in IDA ' s prioritization of assistance efforts, and the depth and focus of some sector assistance efforts, most notably, the financial sector, though likewise, health, and education. Of more fundamental importance was the lack of progress in state institution, and public administration reform.

In 1989 the 35 year dictatorship of General Stroessner ended in a military coup. The incoming government initiated a series of reforms but still faced serious economic and governance challenges. Agricultural expansion was approaching physical and environmental limits. The country's financial institutions were fragile,
public sector management was poor, the legal framework weak and poverty and social unrest were growing concerns. These problems have worsened and the situation today is even more precarious; the fiscal situation has deteriorated, growth has stagnated, corruption persists, the banking sector crisis is not fully resolved.

Jamaica: Hurricane Dean Emergency Recovery Loan (PPAR), PDF file,"Jamaica is highly exposed to natural disasters. The negative impacts on economic development and social well-being are exacerbated as approximately 82 percent of Jamaica’s population lives within 5 kilometers of the coast, increasing the relative vulnerability of residents, major infrastructure, and the housing stock. Hurricane Dean made landfall in Jamaica on August 19, 2007, causing economic losses of roughly $329 million. The hurricane resulted in significant and extensive damage to primary and early childhood schools, community-based health clinics, and parochial and agricultural feeder roads in directly impacted parishes. In the aftermath of the hurricane, Jamaica’s Ministry of Finance confirmed that the recovery would require financial support from multiple sources, both national and international. In that context, the government of Jamaica approached the World Bank to support reconstruction works in poor communities affected by Hurricane Dean. The general aim was the reestablishment of prehurricane living conditions in these communities through the implementation of specific local infrastructure projects that would directly improve the conditions of the most vulnerable populations. Given the ongoing emergency, the World Bank and the government of Jamaica agreed to sign an emergency recovery loan to expedite the disbursement of resources. Additionally, the World Bank and the government of Jamaica agreed that the Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) would be the implementing agency.

Ratings for the Hurricane Dean Emergency Recovery Loan are as follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons from this project include: (i) Using existing agencies with a proven track record can be an effective approach for implementing emergency response projects. (ii) When designing rehabilitation works, close consultation with users can ensure the provision of better services. (iii) Expectations need to be managed as there are limits to how much progress can be made on disaster risk reduction or emergency preparedness under an emergency operation.

Evaluating Public Sector Reform: Guidelines for Assessing Country-Level impact of Structural Reform and Capacity Building in the Public Sector, PDF file,"Recent sectoral and country reviews of World Bank assistance by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) have concluded that support for institutional development (ID) efforts - in both sector-specific and public sector management portfolios - has been largely ineffective. Such efforts to improve public management systems were compromised inter alia by overly technocratic approaches to institutional design, a bias toward supplying capacity inputs (such as training and equipment) before reforming governance structures, as well as reliance on lending instruments that were not sufficiently flexible to accommodate the complex dynamics of institutional change.1 In recognition of this sobering track record, the Bank and its partners have begun to rethink the analytical and operational framework that underpins donor-assisted efforts to enhance countries' institutional endowments. While still a work in progress, a consensus approach is emerging, the broad contours of which include greater emphasis on rigorous measurement of institutional performance, use of more flexible programmatic lending instruments, and sequencing strategies that ensure that ID efforts ""lock in"" improvements in the way public management systems work.", ,Content Type : Reports,"September 1, 2001

"Peru: Country Program Evaluation for the World Bank Group, 2003–09", Web Resource,"Since 2003, Peru has emerged as an open, rapidly growing economy. Over the review period of 2003â09, successive governments adopted policy platforms aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability, furthering the private sector supply response, broadening participation in growth, improving social service delivery, and strengthening public institutions. There was a strong supply response over the review period, with private investment increasing sharply, the economy diversifying into new areas, and gross domestic product (GDP) growing at nearly 7 percent a year. Poverty declined substantially, although unevenly, across Peru's three distinct geographical regions. The World Bank Group (WBG) supported each of the three pillars of the government's poverty reduction strategy, namely: (i) broad-based economic growth that engaged a higher share of the population; (ii) enhanced human development through improved social service delivery; and (iii) strengthened public sector institutions.

During the period FY01-08, the World Bank was Mozambique's largest development partner, providing over $1.3 billion in International Development Association (IDA) funds. The Bank's strategy, which was aligned with and sought to support the government's poverty reduction strategy, focused on three pillars: economic growth, including macroeconomic management, financial and private sector development, rural development, and infrastructure; poverty reduction and human development; and governance. The evaluation finds that the Bank's strategy for Mozambique and its program were relevant to the country's development needs. The Bank's program was generally aligned with those of other development partners that provide general budget support, especially after FY05. Harmonization of procedures with other development partners also progressed, although there is scope for further improvement. Going forward, IEG recommends that the Bank help Mozambique sustain high growth and re-shape its pattern to make additional gains in poverty reduction; give priority in analytic work to infrastructure, agricultural productivity, education quality, and HIV/AIDS; and support improvements in the efficiency of public expenditures.",Country :  Mozambique,Content Type : Reports,"May 10, 2010

"Special Study on the Bank's ""Country Policy and Institutional Assessment"" (CPIA)", PDF file,"Over the past three decades the Bank has been leveraging its considerable analytical, advisory and operational presence in developing countries to systematically assess the key aspects of their policy and institutional performance. Annual country policy assessments were initiated in the late 1970s to help guide the allocation of IDA resources as a key input to the IDA country performance ratings. Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) is also a key ingredient in several important corporate activities; they inform CAS business plans and country policy dialogue, assist in the assessments of portfolio risks by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG), help identify countries requiring extra attention on fiduciary standards and governance, provide a background for IEG CAEs and other evaluation work, as well as inform research on determinants of economic growth and poverty reduction.
The present CPIA Study is closely related to a series of recent and ongoing thematic evaluations on public sector reform; economic and sector work; decentralization; the Doing Business indicators; and development results in middle-income countries. The study would shed some light on the reliability, consistency and usefulness of CPIA ratings.", ,Content Type : Reports,"March 31, 2008

Egypt - Basic Education Improvement Project; and Education Enhancement Program Project, Web Resource ,"The ratings for the Basic Education Improvement Project of Egypt are as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; the Bank performance was satisfactory; and the performance of the Borrower was rated as moderately satisfactory. The ratings for the Education Enhancement Program Project of Egypt are as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to development was moderate; the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and the performance of the Borrower was also rated as moderately satisfactory. The main lessons from the experience of these two projects are as follows: 1) governments may carry out project activities as expected in lending documents but hesitate to implement policies at the agreed pace. Donors who finance hardware activities in expectations of policy changes may face difficult decisions. The donor community may use study results and other information to invite wider public debate on necessary policy changes; 2) in all sectors, a line of reasoning is necessary for linking expected outcomes with activities undertaken during implementation. A clear line of reasoning and attribution of causality is critical in complex projects with multiple components. Efforts must be made to measure intermediate outcomes (such as instructional time use or reading fluency in education) in order to test hypotheses and determine which activities contribute the most to development outcomes; 3) during appraisal and implementation, emphasis is often on the big picture and on global indicators of development objectives. To achieve the expected effects, however, the Bank should pay closer attention to execution of the details, the pixels which constitute the big picture. State-of the art sectoral knowledge and local language knowledge are important in monitoring the degree to which basic skills are achieved; 4) targeted awareness campaigns make it possible to increase female enrollments even in areas that are hard to reach. However, mere enrollments may not be sufficient to help girls' labor market outcomes. Quality education is necessary to increase educational attainment among the poor and disadvantaged; and 5) donor coordination is important in the financing of activities that are to benefit the poor. Complementary skills among donor staff can result in improved project performance in ways that can benefit large and complex countries, like Egypt.", ,Content Type : Reports,"June 25, 2008

It closed on July 31, 2014. The project cost of $23.44 million was financed by a $4 million grant from the International Development Association (IDA) and $17.44 million in grants from the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) and the European Union (EU), which were channeled through a multi-donor trust fund administered by IDA. The Government of Sierra Leone made a counterpart contribution of $2 million. The project’s objective was to sustainably improve the credibility, control, and transparency of fiscal and budget management. Five components made up the project: (i) strengthening macrofiscal coordination and budget management, (ii) reinforcing the control system for improved service delivery, (iii) strengthening central finance functions, (iv) assisting oversight by nonstate actors (NSAs), and (v) project management.

Ratings for the Integrated Public Finance Management Reform Project are as follows: Outcome is unsatisfactory. Risk to development outcome, high, World Bank performance is moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance, moderately unsatisfactory. The major lessons from this project include: (i) In the absence of a conducive PFM policy environment, there are clear limits to what can be achieved through investment project financing alone. (ii) Effective support for improving the demand for good governance can benefit from broadening support beyond civil society organizations to include academia, the media, and the private sector. (iii) In the context of low Internet density, effective public dissemination of state documents calls for combining online publication with alternative means of diffusion. (iv) Effective and sustainable World Bank leadership of multi-donor support to PFM reforms requires a continuous effort by staff to consult with external partners.

It is an agrarian landlocked country, with a population of 18.6 million (2019) growing at 3 percent per year. Between 2013 and 2017 real GDP and real per capita GDP grew at 4.0 and 1.2 percent per year, respectively. The poverty headcount ratio at the national poverty line was 51.5 percent in 2016, slightly above the 50.7 percent in 2010. The Gini index (World Bank estimate) stood at 44.7 in 2016, below its 2010 level of 45.5. The Human Development Index improved from 0.441 in 2010 to 0.47 in 2015 and to 0.477 in 2017. During the review period, Malawi faced several challenges including the governance and public financial management crisis in September 2013 and two natural disasters- the flooding in 2015 which affected half of the country and the drought in 2016. The “cashgate” led to temporary suspension of donor budget support and sharp reduction in disbursement of aid funds through government systems with the consequent impact on the fiscal deficit.

Malawi - Country Assistance Evaluation, PDF file,"This Country Assistance Evaluation on Malawi, reviews the Bank ' s assistance between 1991-1997, and discusses the efficacy of its assistance, questioning the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies, and of changes in production, to reflect on broader, more sustainable growth, and poverty reduction. Despite a decade of adjustment, Malawi showed minimal progress by the early 1990s, namely due to the absence of real change in production structures. The dualistic agriculture sector, in which large estates produced export crops, while small-holders subsistence maize, was largely the remnant of structured price controls, and regulatory restrictions, and, on the other hand, limited industrial production, was due to the constant macroeconomic instability, unattractive investment regulations, poor infrastructure, limited access to finance, and a poor competitive environment, which constrained private activity. The Bank assistance strategy as of the 1990s, aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability, stimulating private sector activity, while diversifying agriculture. However, adverse external shocks affected strategy implementation, aggravated by unwilling governments to address adversity, limiting results from the Bank ' s assistance. Current emerging progress is substantiated by committed governments, supportive of poverty reduction strategies, though reforms, and institutional weakness calls for attention.",Country :  Malawi,Content Type : Reports,"November 14, 2000

For each main program objective, the CAE will evaluate progress toward achieving the objective, including the balance between lending and non-lending, the number of operations, the efficacy with which the strategy was implemented, and the results achieved.  This will be done in two steps.  The first will review whether the program achieved a particular objective or planned outcome and had a substantive impact on the country's development.  To the extent possible, given the lack of comprehensive and reliable data, this analysis will compare the performance indicators set out in the strategies and projects (or baseline values if the strategies lack indicators) to actual results using performance indicators from recent Bank documents, findings of the CAE mission, and other publicly available information.  The second step will review the Bank's products and services (lending, AAA, and donor coordination) used to achieve a particular objective.  An assessment will also be made of the contributions to the results by the Bank, other donors, the government, as well as exogenous factors.

Sri Lanka: Country Assistance Note, PDF file,"The World Bank ' s overall country assistance in the 1990 ' s had a satisfactory outcome and likely sustainability. Not all of what the Bank set out to change in the policy and institutional framework was done, but was done helped propel the country ' s growth and poverty reduction at a substantial speed. However, Bank assistance only had a modest institutional development impact. Thus, OED rates development effectiveness of Bank assistance at the country level as marginally satisfactory. Bank and Borrower performances were also marginally satisfactory, as design and implementation of reforms and projects could have been better and commitment stronger. The 1996 Country Assistance Strategy remains valid. The Bank should continue linking its assistance to progress towards an adequate policy and institutional framework, avoiding projects but continuing to provide analyses and advice in sectors without strong Government commitment to needed reforms. In addition, the Bank should support more actively the Government ' s efforts at peace building and strengthening ethnic harmony, and should help prepare for a phase-out of concessional aid by strengthening the country ' s creditworthiness and capacity to manage capital flows.

The CPS was jointly implemented by IBRD, IFC, and MIGA and covers the joint program of the three World Bank Group (WBG) institutions. The CPS objectives under three pillars were congruent with Kenya's medium- and long-term programs, (i) Pillar 1, ""Unleashing Kenya's Growth Potential,"" sought an improved business environment and competitiveness, improved core infrastructure, and enhanced agricultural productivity, with a focus on food security; (ii) Pillar 2, ""Reducing Inequality and Social Exclusion,"" sought better access to health care, education, and basic infrastructure services, and the establishment of comprehensive scalable social protection mechanisms; and (iii) Pillar 3, ""Managing Resource Constraints and Environmental Challenges,"" included improved management of natural resources and adapting to climate change. The articulated objectives of the CPSPR, were broadly similar to the CPS; however, the CPSPR dropped one of the two environment objectives under CPS Pillar 3, and merged one management of natural resources with Pillar 2. In lieu of the other environmental objective, the CPSPR then introduced a new Pillar 3, ""Governance"" that comprised one of the former CPS Pillar 1 objectives, relabeled in the CPSPR as ""Improved Transparency and Accountability,"" although it maintained the same outcome indicators. IEG rates the overall outcome Moderately Satisfactory. The program clearly met its objectives in the area of natural resource management, met most objectives in areas including business environment, transport, social and basic infrastructure services, but underperformed significantly in the area of Governance. This assessment highlights three lessons, (i) the Bank, IFC, and MIGA work best together when each institution brings something complementary to the collaboration; (ii) robust links of interventions to objectives are critical for results. Sometimes these may be intrinsically difficult to achieve; and (iii) addressing fiduciary performance issues requires close monitoring and collaboration with the government, as well as swift pro-activity on restructuring or suspending problem projects.

This review confirms the widely held view that Stop TB is the one of the best performing global partnerships in the health sector, based on an analysis of its relevance, efficacy, efficiency, governance, and management. Yet the sustainability of its achievements will depend not only on the Partnership itself but also on its ability to successfully confront new challenges posed by HIV and drug resistance, on the complementary disease-control activities of its donor partners, and on the capacity of high-burden countries to sustain TB control.

Third, an emphasis on infrastructure is insufficient unless there is adequate attention to the linkages between urban and rural areas.

Lastly, the assessment rates the overall outcome of the Second Rural Savings and Loans Cooperatives Rehabilitation (Rural Credit II) as unsatisfactory; the project was undermined by the severe problems with the Federation of Rural Savings and Loans Cooperatives, including insufficient training at the local level, defaulted loans owing to the lack of due diligence, and inadequate records on repayment schedules, among other problems. sustainability is unlikely Both the Bank and the Borrower ' s performances are rated unsatisfactory. Experience with this project confirms a number of OED lessons: 1) A feasible plan (both functional and financial) that can be fully implemented is essential when changing the institutiona structure of a major government organization such as the Ministry of Agriculture. The plan must be flexible and capable of being changed as it is being implemented, and periodically monitored so that management can learn what is working and what parts need to be altered during the implementation phase. 2) A decentralized and demand-driven system is a viable approach to the successful delivery of food security and nurition programs. The PILSA project was successful because each community was able to tailor the specific program delivery to its own needs, and because of the expertise of both international and local nongovernmental organizations to implement micro-projects and deliver the nutrition programs.

Bolivia: Country Assistance Evaluation (REACH), PDF file,"After over 10 years of stabilization and structural reform, Bolivia in 1998 appeared to be poised for major development advances. The Bank's FY99-03 program thus adopted accelerated growth, poverty reduction, and human development as its objectives, shifting in FY04 to supporting the government's efforts to manage the social and political crisis that erupted in 2003. Bank support was a major contributing factor to a number of positive developments, such as in health and education. Nevertheless, the overall development outcome of Bank assistance was moderately unsatisfactory because of limited progress in improving the environment for private sector development, increasing rural productivity, and strengthening public sector institutions. This was due in part to external shocks, but in the main to political and social opposition to the government's program. Inadequate appraisal of risks and risk management by the Bank during the FY99-03 period was a contributory factor. The country program was also an innovator with regard to a number of new Bank instruments and processes, but relevance of these innovations in the Bolivia context was questionable and their implementation proved problematic. Looking ahead, the extreme uncertainty that befell Bolivia in 2003 is continuing, with no indication that it will abate. In this environment, the Bank will need to maintain a short-horizon, and will need to focus on fundamental areas where development priorities are clear (e.g., continuing fiscal adjustment) and areas where prospects for effective use of development support are greatest.",Country :  Bolivia,Content Type : Reports,"September 30, 2005

Mozambique - Country partnership strategy for the period FY08-FY11 : IEG CPSCR review, Web Resource ,"This review examines implementation of the Fiscal Years 2008-11 Mozambique Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), and evaluates the CPS Completion Report (CPSCR). The strategy was implemented by IDA, IFC and MIGA, and this review covers their joint program. The World Bank Group (WBG) strategy in Mozambique was organized around three pillars: (i) increasing accountability and public voice; (ii) ensuring equitable access to key services; and (iii) promoting equitable and broad-based growth.  
IEG rates the overall outcome of the WBG strategy in Mozambique as moderately unsatisfactory. With support from several external development partners, including IDA, Mozambique has made progress in improving budget planning at the central and district levels, in establishing information technology systems that bolster the government's fiduciary systems, and started to give communities a say in the budget process.  These improvements, however, have yet to translate into better governance indicators. The main lesson stemming from this review is that the WBG's development effectiveness rests on active and effective management of the country strategy and operations, and not only on a dedicated and strong country staff. Efficient monitoring and evaluation of the strategy and taking the opportunity of a CPSPR to update the objectives and interventions to changing circumstances and exogenous developments are crucial components to enhance the development effectiveness of the WBG and of its staff.  These functions, however, are the purview of senior management.",Country :  Mozambique,Content Type : Reports,"March 27, 2012

Ukraine Country Assistance Evaluation, PDF file,"This Country Assistance Evaluation reports on the period from 1992 to 1998 of World Bank involvement with the Government of Ukraine and its economic transition and development efforts. Sixteen projects, a substantial economic and social sector work program and an active policy dialogue that covered moist aspects of economic life are reviewed. The report presents a synthesis of the evaluation findings describing a comprehensive and intense country assistance program. This report ' s main conclusion is that the Bank assistance to the Ukraine has been only partially effective, and while the partnership forged with the government has helped to move the necessary transition reform agenda forward, little progress has been made in some key areas. Achieving a degree of macroeconomic stability and eliminating hyperinflation has been a notable success, although the sustainability of these advances is still somewhat uncertain. Good progress has been made in privatization, trade and price liberalization, and in strengthening the central bank. Partial progress has been made in reforming the country ' s crucial agricultural sector and focusing attention on restructuring the coal sector.

Ecuador - Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses development effectiveness focusing on the institutional and financial aspects of the Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project in Ecuador (PRAGUAS), which was the first phase of a three-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL). PRAGUAS combined investment in water supply and sanitation infrastructure and technical assistance to improve the performance of key water sector institutions. At the time of project preparation, Ecuador had rural populations with low access to water supply and sanitation (WSS) services. Improving rural access to WSS was identified as a government priority for the country.
IEG rated the relevance of the project's objectives as substantial, but the relevance of the design as modest. The objective related to increasing WSS access was achieved, while the objective relating to the sector reform was achieved only modestly. Putting together the elements on relevance, efficiency, and achievement of objectives, the overall outcome was rated moderately satisfactory. IEG rated the risk to development outcome as significant because of the risks associated with the communities' and municipalities' financial capacity to maintain their RWSS systems over the longer term. As for the Bank's Performance, the overall IEG rating is moderately satisfactory because the project design was over-ambitious given the potentially politically sensitive time period in which the project was being prepared, and poor quality of monitoring and evaluation. The borrowers' performance was moderately satisfactory, with shortcomings on the government side due to the delays in sector policy formalization and implementation of sector reforms.", ,Content Type : Reports,"June 28, 2011

Evaluation of World Bank Support for Public Sector Reform (FTB), PDF file,"The effectiveness and efficiency of a country's public sector is vital to the success of development activities, including those the World Bank supports. Sound financial management, an efficient civil service and administrative policy, efficient and fair collection of taxes, and transparent operations that are relatively free of corruption all contribute to good delivery of public services.  The Bank has devoted an increasing share now about one-fifthâof its lending and advisory support to the reform of central governments, so it is important to understand what is working, what needs improvement, and what is missing. To address these questions, IEG has examined lending and other kinds of Bank support in 1999-2006 for public sector reform in four areasâpublic financial management, administrative and civil service, revenue administration, and anticorruption and transparency.  Although a majority of countries that borrowed to support public sector reform experienced improved performance in some dimensions, there were shortcomings in important areas and in overall coordination. The frequency of improvement was higher among IBRD borrowers than among IDA borrowers. Performance usually improved for public financial management, tax administration, and transparency, but performance did not usually improve with respect to civil service. Direct measures to reduce corruptionâsuch as anticorruption laws and commissionsârarely succeeded. Recommendations to the Bank focus on improving guidelines for civil service and anticorruption reforms and on setting realistic objectives and sequencing for reforms.", ,Content Type : Reports,"February 26, 2008

Mexico Country Program Evaluation FY08-17 (Approach Paper), PDF file,"The core purpose of this document is to assess the development effectiveness of the World Bank Group country program in Mexico between FY2008 and FY2017. While Mexico has been a member of the OECD since 1994, its per capita GNI is the lowest among OECD members – 58 percent below the OECD average in 2016, in PPP terms – and its poverty rate is the highest in that group of mostly high income countries. Compared to upper middle income countries (UMICs), however, Mexico’s per capita GNI is 7 percent above the average of that group. Its latest, 2014 poverty rate, 5.7 percent, is comparatively low, measured using the international poverty line of $1.9 in 2011 PPP terms, but it is much higher, at 11.7 and 27.5 percent, if measured at poverty lines of $2.5 and $4, respectively (2005 PPP). The Government of Mexico’s strategic priorities have been focused on unlocking the country’s full potential, in terms not only of economic growth, but also of improved human development, gender equity, environmental protection and enhanced democratic governance and security. Over the period of analysis, the WBG aligned its strategic priorities with those embedded in the National Development Plans of two successive presidential administrations. The CPE will assess the WBG’s contributions to Mexico’s achievements in each of the Group’s priority areas of engagement. It will also evaluate the extent to which the WBG took advantage of potential synergies between the financial, knowledge and convening services that WBG institutions offered across its various engagement areas, to maximize overall contributions to Mexico’s national development goals.

Bangladesh Country Assistance Evaluation, PDF file,"This Country Assistance Evaluation assesses the outcomes of World Bank programs in Bangladesh from 2001 to 2008. Bangladesh is among the Bank's largest IDA-eligible borrowers; despite the political economy challenges, it has made significant progress in poverty reduction, growth, exports, and human development. The Bank's strategy during the review period was to support the government in improving broad governance as well as under two pillars: bettering the investment climate and empowering the poor. IDA's contribution to the country's development was positive, and IEG rated the overall outcome as moderately satisfactory. IDA's strategy was relevant to the country's development needs, and aligned with those of other development partners. There were positive outcomes in the areas of public financial management, tackling corruption, private sector development and human development. However, support fell short in civil service reform, legal and judicial reform, voice and empowerment, transportation and water supply and sanitation. IFC realized only a few new investments in the financial and manufacturing sectors, because the weak overall business environment affected its ability to make new investments. Bangladesh still faces considerable challenges in promoting sustainable and faster growth and reducing poverty more quickly, and its environmental challenges are substantial. Within this framework, IEG recommends that IDA should use a broad range of instruments to support complex reforms; break with past stop-go patterns even in difficult sectors; strengthen monitoring and evaluation; fully engage local counterparts; and enhance coordination with development partners.

Indonesia - Community-based Settlement Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project for Central and West Java and Yogyakarta Special Region, Web Resource ,"The government of Indonesia committed approximately $600 million to fund the reconstruction and rehabilitation of approximately 255,000 homes in the earthquake-affected areas. Several development partners also contributed funds for a significantly smaller reconstruction initiative. At the government’s request, the World Bank used these additional contributions to create a recipient-executed Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF). The World Bank used the JRF’s resources to create the Community-Based Settlement Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (CSRRP) for Central and West Java and Yogyakarta Special Region. The CSRRP’s objective was to assist in meeting the needs of eligible households for earthquake-resistant housing and community infrastructure in the affected areas. These objectives were to be achieved through a community-based approach in which beneficiaries would have a major role in decision-making about reconstruction of their homes and the construction of their communities’ infrastructure.

Ratings for the Community-based Settlement Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (CSRRP) are as follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development are modest, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Key lessons from the experience of the project include the following: (i) A community-based approach to postdisaster reconstruction can be effective and efficient in a context in which there is prior experience and existing institutions and cultural norms that favor it. (ii) Careful attention is essential in deciding who will be assisted financially in reconstructing homes, the amount of assistance to be provided, and the perceived effects and consequences of these decisions. (iii) The disaster resilience of project-provided housing can be undermined by subsequent expansion or enlargement of the housing. (iv) Community settlement or similar development plans may not meaningfully support disaster risk reduction unless these plans meet several essential conditions. (v) Women’s participation in community-driven development is a challenge to ensure when their interests, experiences, and perspectives are not properly considered in a project’s design, for example, through a gender analysis that identifies potential opportunities and obstacles to their meaningful participation in decision-making.

Estonia - Agriculture Project, Web Resource ,"Project ratings are as follows: Project outcome is rates highly satisfactory; sustainability is likely, institutional development impact is high; Bank performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is also satisfactory. Experience with this project confirms a number of OED lessons: (a) Effective operational linkages between related project components help improve project outcomes. The aim of the farm drainage rehabilitation component was to bring flooded land back into farm production. In addition, drainage rehabilitation was also used successfully to promote privatization by requiring recipients of drainage assistance to cross-comply with the privatization objectives under land reform. Farmers had to buy or sign long-term lease agreements on state-owned land in the drainage area and had to accept responsibility for future drainage costs. Setting these conditions established a "" give and take "" approach, which ensured that farmers both contributed and were committed to the drainage objectives and to the privatization objectives under land reform. This served to advance more than one objective with the same investment of resources under the project. (b) A private sector delivery system for extension services can be an effective alternative to public sector delivery, provided that there are appropriate incentives, firtancia1 controls, and audit procedures. In this case, private delivery (1) allowed swift implementation, (2) avoided the future costs of having to dismantle a public delivery system after having met transition requirements, (3) contributed to developing a base of private sector expertise to meet the long-term aim of having the market provide certain extension services on a user-pay basis, (4) recognized the private sector ' s capacity for providing a diversity of extension expertise, and (5) respected the preferences of farmers for less government involvement in their business affairs. (c) In identifying projects for development assistance, the Bank should pay close attention to those where the borrower is likely to take strong ownership, responsibility and control of the project, because such conditions contribute significantly to achieving positive project outcomes. The Estonian Agriculture Project is an excellent example where the borrower possessed a strong desire to own the project from the beginning to the end. This contributed greatly to a project likely to generate highly positive benefits for the Estonian agricultural and rural economies. Based on the Estonia example, indicators to look for in identifying a borrower likely to take and maintain ownership and responsibility include (1) a strong sense of policy direction when entering into discussions with the Bank; (2) already taking steps within its means toward realization of the policy direction; and (3) exhibiting a desire to disengage from the Bank ' s assistance as soon as possible. Each of these indicators was very much in evidence with respect to the Estonia project.",Country :  Estonia,Content Type : Reports,"June 28, 2004

"Indonesia - First, Second, and Third Phase of the Provincial Health Project", Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews the performance of three health projects in Indonesia, the (i) Provincial Health I (effective from August 2000 through December 2007); (ii) Provincial Health II (from April 2002 through July 2009); and (iii) Health Work Force and Services Project (Provincial Health III) (from December 2003 through December 2008). The projects shared two development objectives, (i) to pilot effective health sector decentralization in selected provinces; and (ii) to support the Ministry of Health (MOH) in its new oversight role within the decentralized health system. The Health Work Force and Services Project (Provincial Health III) had a third, additional objective, to support effective health workforce policy and management. Decentralization was seen as an opportunity to revitalize a public health system that was facing coverage, quality, and equity challenges, as well as declining demand for public health services. 
The outcome of each of the three projects is rated unsatisfactory.  Key lessons include, (i) planning for and managing risks when undertaking extensive policy reforms is essential for achieving success, especially in a rapidly changing environment; (ii) a strong monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework is a prerequisite when undertaking potential high-risk/high-potential operations and that it incorporates appropriate technical as well as political economy indicators, and includes a schedule for rigorous assessment of progress and results; (iii) goals and project organization need to be well understood and supported by the client--at national and sub-national levels--for achieving effective M&E and learning. This also requires collaborative project development and continuous socialization of the project among participants to ensure client ownership; (iv) sufficiently existing technical capabilities to take on new roles are also a prerequisite for success. The design and timing of inputs--the roadmap for implementation--must be calibrated to ensure clients' absorptive capacity exists; (v) institutional flexibility and adaptability of processes, checks and balances is critical, particularly when piloting new methods; (vi) project sequencing is critical given the context and complex reforms to be undertaking, for example, to allow for sufficient opportunities for transmittal of learning from one project to another.", ,Content Type : Reports,"November 13, 2013

The Philippines : disaster risk management development policy loan with a catastrophe deferred drawdown option, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) evaluates the Philippines Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT DDO). The loan of US$500 million was approved in September 2011, fully drawn down in December 2011 when the disbursement trigger was met, and closed in October 2014. The PPAR reviews the performance of this operation based on IEG and Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) guidelines on program evaluations. The Philippines CAT DDO aimed to enhance the capacity of the Government of the Philippines to manage the impacts of natural disasters. To this end, the program supported objectives in three policy areas: (i) strengthening the institutional capacity for disaster risk management (DRM) efforts; (ii) mainstreaming DRM into development planning; and (iii) better managing the government's fiscal exposure to natural hazard impacts. The operation was complemented by a technical assistance program from the World Bank Global Fund for Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR) to provide targeted support in these areas.
Ratings for the Disaster Risk Management and Development Policy Loan project were as follows: outcome was satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons gleamed from the review are: (i) The CAT DDO proved to be a useful instrument in the Philippines for achieving the dual objectives of supporting fundamental DRM reforms and providing quick-release financing for disaster recovery and reconstruction. (ii) As with all policy reforms, in-depth analytical work and well-targeted technical assistance were critical for achieving results. (iii) In the context of this operation, there were multiple confusions over the purposes of a CAT DDO and the use of the loan proceeds, which call for further clarification in World Bank documents and better communication.

Bangladesh - Strengthening Public Expenditure Management Program - Strengthening Auditor General’s Office, Web Resource ,"This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the World Bank’s project on Bangladesh: Strengthening Auditor General’s Office. The project was selected as part of a pilot initiative by IEG to improve the relevance of the instrument. The PPAR draws lessons from the World Bank’s experience in the context of a challenging public financial management, governance, and political economy environment. The original project development objectives were to (i) strengthen the institutional arrangements of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (OCAG), (ii) enhance the quality and scope of audits, and (iii) enhance the institutional capacity of the Financial Management Academy (FIMA). Reflecting government reluctance to enact the underlying legal changes required by the operation, the project development objectives were revised in 2014 to (i) strengthen the quality, scope, and follow-up of audits; and (ii) create a cadre of internationally accredited professionals in OCAG.

Ratings for the Strengthening Public Expenditure Management Program - Strengthening Auditor General’s Office project are as follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Lesson from the project include: (1) Inadequate assessment of political economy risks to key reforms contributed to unrealistically ambitious project design and targets, leading to shortcomings in implementation. (ii) The project sought to implement a politically sensitive policy reform through the use of technical assistance. The objective could have been more effectively pursued through a different instrument, possibly a development policy operation. (iii) The ability for a pilot to effectively demonstrate the potential of a new way of doing business requires commitment to a systematic assessment of the pilot experience and the dissemination of lessons learned.

Ethiopia - Seeds Systems Development Project and National Fertilizer Sector Project, Web Resource ,"This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) of the Ethiopia Seed Systems Development Project (SSDP) and the Ethiopia National Fertilizer Sector Project (NFSP). The Seed Systems Development Project's outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory. SSDP successfully achieved its main objective to decentralize and strengthen the government seed-producing agency, the Ethiopian Seed Enterprise (ESE). However, it failed to achieve its secondary objective to promote seed production by private firms, and informal seed production by farmers; and ESE retains a nearly exclusive monopoly of seed production. Substantial performance improvements are still required to achieve project objectives. The National Fertilizer Sector Project's outcome is rated unsatisfactory. The NFSP successfully assisted fertilizer sector institutions to strengthen capacity, but failed to achieve its main objective to create a competitive fertilizer market with private sector participation. Instead, the private sector left the market and the government became the monopoly supplier. Significant performance improvements are still required for NFSP to achieve a satisfactory outcome, hence risk to development outcome is rated significant. The experiences of SSDP and NFSP provide six main lessons: (1) Strategically oriented sector work is essential as a base for a relevant and effective rural development program; (2) Better coordination and linkages are needed between projects and within the rural sector as a whole; (3) Development of a competitive fertilizer market requires actions beyond ""Market Liberalization""; (4) Reliance on the public sector for input supply may create not only market inefficiencies but also a shortage of inputs; (5) Institutional structures and processes can restrict private sector participation; and (6) A one-sized-fits-all agricultural extension system has limited impact.",Country :  Ethiopia,Content Type : Reports,"June 21, 2007

State Your Business: What are the keys to successful reform of state-owned enterprises? , Web Resource,"State-Owned Enterprises SOEs are critical to many developing and emerging economies where the lives of millions of citizens are deeply affected by how these enterprises are run. Governments use SOEs to provide services across multiple sectors and to address the impacts of economic downturns or crises, such as the current COVID-19 crisis.  

Although many SOEs are run well and have made important economic contributions, many others suffer from low productivity and efficiency, which have a detrimental impact on growth and consumer access to services. SOEs’ mixed institutional mandates and their political importance often pose performance and governance challenges. Poor performance can also generate substantial public fiscal losses. Aware of the importance of SOE reform to achieving economic development and service delivery goals, the World Bank Group (WBG) has long supported developing countries to address the associated challenges.  

IEG recently published the evaluation State Your Business! An Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to the Reform of State-Owned Enterprises, its first systematic assessment of the Bank Group’s support for the reform of SOEs, focusing on the energy and financial sectors, where Bank Group investments in the last decade have surpassed USD 70 billion.

The political importance of SOEs can impose substantial challenges to introducing and sustaining reforms. Such political economy risk factors help to explain why countries such as Bangladesh, Egypt, and Indonesia have signaled their intent to privatize state-owned banks but later halted efforts because of internal political constraints. The allocation and pricing of power and finance can evoke intense public reaction and mobilize vested interests.  Further, temporary crisis response programs can turn into irreversible “policy traps”, locking SOEs in to underfunded mandates even if it damages their long-term viability.   

IEG’s evaluation sheds light on key factors driving successful SOE reforms and points to risks and obstacles that limit reforms with potentially dire consequences for SOE performance and delivery of services to the public. These factors include:  

Sector competition 

Research on the subject shows that enhanced competition improves SOE performance in both the financial and power sectors, both by itself and in combination with other reforms. First, there is strong evidence that SOEs perform better in the power sector (and in general) when competitive conditions prevail at the sector and enterprise levels. For example, an econometric assessment of power sector data for 36 developing and transition countries over 18 years found that gains in economic performance stemmed mainly from allowing private participation.  

Privatization or regulatory reforms were less effective without a competitive market. Private sector participation can take various forms and involve different functions of the power market (generation, transmission, distribution, and retail). A key aim of Bank Group support has been to strengthen competition and regulation in SOE markets, in part to foster a level playing field between SOEs and private companies 

One example of WBG support to achieve a more competitive power market is in Vietnam, where Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) and other SOEs dominated power generation. EVN also fully owned the entity that operates and maintains the national transmission grid.  

The Bank Group engaged comprehensively in all aspects of the power sector (rural electrification, generation, transmission, distribution, load dispatch, renewables, development of wholesale and retail power markets, regulatory aspects, and SOE reform), using a wide range of instruments. The credibility and trust generated enabled the Bank Group to support the government in sequencing sector wide reform. 

In 2012, EVN unbundled its generation subsidiaries into three separate generation companies, at the same time as the launch of Vietnam’s competitive generation market, in which independent power producers and generation companies compete in a power pool to sell to individual buyers. As of 2016, 24 percent of installed capacity in Vietnamese power generation was privately held.  

In the financial sector, research shows bank concentration is more constraining to firms’ access to credit in countries with higher shares of state bank ownership. More competitive environments enhance the benefits of bank privatization. 

The Bank Group's private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) has committed to promoting “competitive neutrality” in the SOEs that it invests in.  

Given the greater success of reforms with better competitive conditions, the IEG report recommends that the World Bank Group should gear up to do more competition analysis at the sector and project level, as part of a selectivity framework for engaging in SOE reform. 

Control of Corruption 

The oversight and accountability challenges of SOEs noted above can make them hard to manage and frequently exposes them to corruption. Corruption powerfully undermines SOE performance. In Ukraine, for example, widespread corruption impeded the progress of SOE reforms. By June 2018, more than 194 of the 793 criminal proceedings handled by Ukraine’s National Anticorruption Bureau dealt with about 50 SOEs and their officials, according to an OECD report. In Kenya, petty corruption among field staff responsible for installing and reading electricity meters reportedly hindered efforts to stem power system losses.  

The IEG report finds that a country’s control of corruption is strongly associated with the likelihood of SOE reform success. Other things being equal, a country with high control of corruption is more than twice as likely to see SOE reform interventions succeed as a country with low control of corruption. In conditions of low control of corruption, it is more difficult to strengthen the governance, regulation, or performance of public enterprises. 

IEG thus recommends that the Bank Group apply a selectivity framework for its engagements on SOE reform that considers country governance conditions. Where corruption control in the country is weak, IEG recommends that World Bank Group either sequence SOE reforms (first addressing public governance) or actively mitigate corruption risks through close attention to the strength of client commitment, supervision, simplicity of project design, and appropriate sequencing. 

Mobilizing Private Finance 

In its review of the Bank Group's experience, IEG found positive experiences from collaboration across its institutions, a key to mobilizing private financing and capabilities. Yet, IEG found these examples somewhat infrequent. The IEG report recommends scaling up the collaborative approach known as “Maximizing Finance for Development” (MFD) to enhance internal coordination among WBG units and help mobilize private financing and capacity including through ownership reforms such as privatization and public-private partnerships. 

However, the recommendation to prioritize private solutions for SOE reforms through an MFD “cascade” approach is not a call for privatization alone. Rather, the World Bank Group should consider a full range of options, including improving regulation and competition, strengthening SOEs’ corporate governance, or supporting ownership reform. The end goal may range from better preparing SOEs to tap private capital markets, to creating a level playing field for competition between private companies and SOEs, to public-private partnerships or outright privatization.   

Sequential and Complementary Support 

IEG found that sequential and complementary interventions, often involving more than one Bank Group institution, aid successful reform. This includes good prior analytic work. For example, over many years, WBG strategies and programs in Bangladesh’s power sector were aligned with successive government five-year plans. Since at least 2004, the Bank Group engaged in unbundling and building technical capacity through financing and technical assistance. This covered regulation, generation, transmission, and distribution.  

The World Bank also supported the successful Power Cell, which channeled technical, planning, and coordination support to government while facilitating the role of private power producers. The regulator, Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission, benefited from WBG support since its creation. The World Bank, IFC, and MIGA (the WBG’s agency for insuring against political risk) were all involved in a “cascade” approach in supporting independent power providers. Over time, sector performance improved in reduced losses, reduced arrears, and an elimination of the energy gap, with the Bank Group as a trusted partner bringing expertise in the field, access to global expertise, long-standing relationships with key government agencies, coordination of donors, and a consistent policy view. 

Through selectivity, coordination and sequencing, the Bank Group can help client countries better serve their citizens through SOE reform. This is especially pressing now as governments cope with the effects of the pandemic and launch economic recovery efforts.

Assistance to the Transition Economies: Were There Alternatives?, PDF file,"Twelve years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, domestic and international analysts of the transition economies by and large agree that the transition from central planning to a market economy has been exceedingly difficult. There has also been a major debate about the extent to which the transition to date has succeeded or failed. In this paper, I provide an assessment of the policies that were followed and I discuss the extent to which there were known alternatives that could have resulted in superior outcomes in terms of (a) GDP growth and other principal performance indicators, (b) building honest and competent institutions and (c) creating a more transparent and less corrupt system of corporate and national governance.", ,Content Type : Reports,"June 1, 2002

The World Bank's Partnership with the GAVI Alliance, PDF file,"GAVI is the third largest multilateral in the health sector. It has a single-purpose mandate, to increase access to immunization in poor countries. The World Bank is a founding partner to GAVI and remains a major partner, particularly at a financial level by supporting operations of two major innovative financial mechanisms on its behalf. By design, GAVI itself does not have a presence at the country level and relies heavily on its partners, WHO and UNICEF, for planning and implementing country activities. While the Bank's financial engagement on behalf of GAVI has been transformative, this review identifies opportunities for stronger Bank engagement in immunization activities at the country level, in GAVI's governance, and in broader immunization policy discussions.

Mozambique Country Program Evaluation (Approach Paper), PDF file,"Mozambique’s recent history is characterized by economic growth, rising inequality, and fragility. After the end of a civil war in 1992, Mozambique enjoyed a sustained period of growth until 2014, positioning it as one of the fastest-growing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Such growth, however, was not broadly shared and inequality increased. Fragility in Mozambique traces back to the uneven historical development of the state, in part shaped by geographical characteristics, and to the nature of the political settlement and the exclusionary political arrangements that it maintains. This evaluation seeks to assess the World Bank Group’s success at helping Mozambique address challenges that constrain its development. The evaluation will cover fiscal years (FY)08–21 and is timed to inform Mozambique’s next Country Partnership Framework (CPF). The evaluation will assess the Bank Group’s support for addressing three development challenges and drivers of fragility in Mozambique: (i) rural poverty linked to weak agricultural productivity and regional inequalities; (ii) weak institutions and governance; and (iii) vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change.",Country :  Mozambique,Content Type : Reports,"June 29, 2021

Learning Product on Environmental Policy Lending (Concept Note), PDF file,"Environmental policy is a crucial driver of environmental outcomes and in terms development and poverty outcomes, as policy environments affect incentives and shift behavior by public and private sector agents. As noted in the World Bank Group's Environment Strategy, policies can be critical in enabling the private sector to use natural resources sustainably, to support inclusive and resilient decision-making, to improve governance risks, to remove perverse incentives, and to encourage sustainable growth policies. Supporting policy reforms remains a high priority for the strategy.
Policy lending has been a major part of the World Bank's lending operations for decades, supporting economic policy and institutional reforms. Before 2004, policy lending occurred through a range of instruments, including Structural Adjustment Loans (SALs) and Sectoral Adjustment Loans (SECALS). Since 2004, policy lending has been consolidated through use of the Development Policy Operation (DPO), which changed the approach to emphasize fewer conditions and stronger country ownership. The DPO instrument has been used in different ways by the Bank. Many DPOs aim to support economy-wide, multi-sector reforms that include, for example, governance, financial sector, energy, and trade and competitiveness issues. In the past, most DPOs were multi-sector operations. However, over time the number of sectoral DPOs has grown substantially in number and commitment amounts over time. Lending through sectoral DPOs has grown particularly for policy lending with environmental goals. This Learning Product focusses on experience with DPOs in the Environment sector, broadly defined. This experience covers a wide range of sectors, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, green growth, natural resource management, disaster risk management, forestry, environmental policy, and others.

Zambia - Agricultural Sector Investment Program, Web Resource ,"Project outcome is rated unsatisfactory, sustainability unlikely, institutional development modest, and Bank and Borrower performance rated unsatisfactory. The project is rated against its original objectives, which were not achieved. The original project design failed to deliver and it is on this that the project is rated. The restructuring and decentralization of the central ministry took much longer than anticipated. Many donors became disillusioned particularly since a number had argued for completing the restructuring before this project. The concept of the project as an umbrella to unify 180 separate donor-funded projects, was not sufficiently owned by the donors and was something of a mirage in the absence of a common donor funding pot, which had never been a realistic possibility. The Bank belatedly, after three years, at the midterm review, narrowed the concept to support a limited number of specific investments. Even the project as restructured/scaled down does not appear to have achieved most of the revised objectives. With respect to restructuring the ministry, this had some initial benefits through decentralization but modest impact on the efficiency of the headquarters. With respect to research, project funds were used for a number of specific research programs of some value and for setting up the Golden Valley Agricultural Research Trust (GART), but most of this does not seem to have increased the flow or quality of technology much. The new of released new varieties appears to have been declining. Extension did shift direction from the top-down training & visit (T & V) system to a more promising participatory group-based approach, but, with operating fund problems, it is questionable in practice how much real impact this has had. With respect to sector reforms, where there is largely limited and indirect attribution to the project or to the associated program dialogue, implementation performance has been mixed and unstable. Fertilizer subsidies were removed but have been revived. A proposed new Crop Marketing Authority will aim to attempt to stabilize prices and through purchasing and selling coarse grains without impacting on private sector marketing. Lessons learned include: 1) The minimum requirements to reduce risk in sector-wide programs to an acceptable level are: realism of expectations; a strong lead agency with, at most, modest reform needs; clear characterization of the donor harmonization sought; a sector where the timing is right; and a depth and breadth of government ownership sufficient for the scale of the task. 2) Projecting the detailed steps and phasing for policy and institutional reform is important. 3) Defining what is a realistic outcome within an immediate project time frame is important--the project lacked shorter-term monitorable substantive performance indicators and did not correct for this at the Mid-term Review. Project supervision reports need to reflect updated progress towards achievement of objectives and to signal to management what actions are needed. 5) In preparing for policy reforms the impact of each reform on the productive capacity and incomes of the poor in different locations should be projected.",Country :  Zambia,Content Type : Reports,"June 23, 2003

China - NanGuang railway project, Web Resource ,"The purpose of this Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the World Bank’s NanGuang Railway Project in China is to offer closer and deeper insights on the project’s outcome, based on updated evidence, including an assessment of the project’s contribution to sector reform and institutional improvement. The PPAR is the first of three PPARs, each for a World Bank–financed large railway investment project in China that was completed over the past five years. Although the World Bank’s financing ranged from US$200 million to US$300 million and accounted for a small percentage of the total cost for each project, all three projects provided a platform for railway sector policy engagements between the World Bank and the Government. The goal of the NanGuang Railway Project was to enhance transport services in a congested corridor connecting a large and populous less-developed western region in Southwest China and the more-developed Pearl River delta region, with the aim of contributing to regional economic development. The project was also intended to serve as a platform for the World Bank to continue its policy engagement with the Government of China in the railway sector. 

Ratings for the NanGuang Railway Project are as follows: Outcome is satisfactory, Risk to development outcome is negligible, Bank performance is satisfactory, and Borrower performance is satisfactory. Lessons from the project include: (i) Sound technical design, project preparation, and implementation management, combined with a strong financial capacity, are a recipe for success for a high-speed railway project. (ii) Agglomeration effects are an important benefit of high-speed rail development and should be incorporated in the benefit-cost analysis of such projects. (iii) Successful reforms in large and complex infrastructure sectors such as railways in China require sustained policy dialogue and engagements. (iv) Good connections of high-speed railway lines with other transport modes and between the rail stations and urban centers are critical to achieving the full benefits of high speed trains.",Country :  China,Content Type : Reports,"June 26, 2018

Romania - Hazard Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project, Web Resource ,"Romania’s Hazard Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness (HRMEP) project, which was implemented between 2004 and 2012, was one of the World Bank’s first efforts to provide ex ante assistance to reduce or mitigate a country’s vulnerabilities to natural disasters related to floods, landslides, and earthquakes. The government sought the support of the World Bank to reduce vulnerability to these and other natural disasters in a proactive manner, leading to the approval of the HRMEP. The project development objective (PDO) was to assist the government in reducing the environmental, social, and economic vulnerability to natural disasters and catastrophic mining accident spills of pollutants. The PDO also included how the objective would be achieved: (i) the strengthening of emergency management and risk financing capacity; (ii) earthquake risk reduction; (iii) flood and landslide risk reduction; and, (iv) risk reduction of mining accidents in the Tisza Basin in northwest Romania.
Ratings for the Hazard Risk Emergency Preparedness Project are as follows: Outcome was moderately unsatisfactory, Risk to development outcome was significant, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Key lessons from the experience of the project include the following: (i) Depending on multiple, functionally independent implementing agencies for multisector projects can increase complexity without providing commensurate benefits. (ii) Multisectoral, multihazard efforts to reduce vulnerability to disasters may not offer synergies or economies of scope in the absence of clear logical links between activities and incentives for coordination by the institutions responsible for them. (iii) In a project designed to mitigate the risk of natural disasters, it is essential that sites critical for vulnerability reduction are both properly identified and systematically supported throughout the life of a project. (iv) When supporting structural retrofits, financing only the retrofitting and not the cost of returning buildings to functionality is likely to lead to problems with implementation.

This assessment covers two projects: Vietnam School Readiness and Promotion Project, and the Global Partnership for Education-Vietnam Escuela Nueva Project. Objectives for these projects are:  (i) to raise school readiness for five-year old children, in particular for those most vulnerable to not succeeding in a school environment, through supporting selected elements of Vietnam’s Early Childhood Education (ECE) program, and (ii) to introduce and use new teaching and learning practices in the classroom targeting the most disadvantaged groups of primary students.

IEG identified the following lessons from its evaluation of the two operations: (i) In addition to lending, the World Bank can add value through the transmission of knowledge from experiences and lessons that help shape reforms. (ii) When significant pedagogical changes are required of teachers, incentives, support, and long-term commitment are needed (probably more than education systems realize). (iii) When scaling up or adopting a systemwide approach, it is important to understand and design this approach in accordance with the decentralized context and challenges faced at the various levels of administration. (iv) Targeting disadvantaged areas does not translate into targeted efforts for specific vulnerable groups.

It analyzes the objectives and content of the Bank's assistance program during this period, the outcomes in terms of economic and social development in Pakistan, and the contributions of the Bank and other development partners to development outcomes. In sum, the outcomes of Bank support for macroeconomic management and growth have achieved success in some areas, especially in the last few years. However, outcomes of Bank assistance were unsatisfactory in poverty reduction and social sector development, governance, agriculture and natural resource management, and revenue mobilization and expenditure management. Therefore, overall outcomes of the Bank's assistance program are rated moderately unsatisfactory. World Bank project performance has been uneven. The Bank portfolio improved greatly after a portfolio clean-up in 1999. Bank documents show that problems of commitment and institutional capacity appeared consistently as major impediments to project implementation and sustainability; yet, project design did not do enough to take these ongoing problems into account. The Bank's analytical work was generally of good quality. However, its relevance and timeliness could be improved through strategic work in areas such as rural development, the social sectors, and power. In addition, in the early part of the review period, insufficient resources were spent on ESW. The Bank is now devoting more resources to analytical and strategic work, which should improve project performance and overall outcomes. Going forward, the Bank would need to focus on the following priorities: (i) continuation of its strong support of analytical work, augmented by translating the analysis into implementable and prioritized actions and programs, and taking into account political economy constraints. Priorities are in poverty, rural development, and governance; (ii) greater focus on building sustainable institutional capacity; (iii) narrowing the scope of projects, and scaling them to fit the capacity of the implementing agencies; (iv) improving partnerships.",Country :  Pakistan,Content Type : Reports,"February 17, 2006

IEG Review of World Bank Assistance for Financial Sector Reform, PDF file,"This Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) review of World Bank assistance for financial sector reforms finds that the objectives of Bank assistance generally followed good practices in terms of reducing government ownership of financial intermediaries; improving prudential regulation to be consistent with international norms; and strengthening banking supervision to adhere more closely to international principles. This review also finds, however, that consistency within a country has been weak at timesâe.g., advocating the privatization of banks while simultaneously supporting the expansion of government ownership of banksâand should be improved. The coherence of the Bank's approach to financial sector reforms across countries has also been weak at timesâe.g., advocating rapid privatization in one transition country while recommending a slow, gradual approach to privatization in another transition country. The report recomends that: (1) The Bank's FSB should provide more guidance for Bank staff and client countries in areas such as the restructuring of banks; asset management companies; the privatization of banks; the promotion of capital markets; and on topics related to strengthening the legal, regulatory, and supervisory environment, and be more proactive in its quality control of financial sector components in multisector loans. (2) The Bank should develop monitorable indicators to assess progress on objectives in the area of prudential regulations and supervision for financial intermediaries. (3) On support for countries prior to and following crises, the Bank should, in partnership with other relevant institutions, develop a ratings system for vulnerability to crisis, using readily available information to engage countries in crisis-prevention measures and issues in crisis response.

            disagreement between the Bank and the government as to the

            its assistance with the government objectives. If this is

The paper argues that African governments, along with their development partners, need to develop a more robust adaptation and response capability to disasters as part of their overall development planning. The paper makes the case for more market-based financing mechanisms than have been used hitherto and for an emphasis on forecasting research.

For most of the past two decades, both governments and donors, including the World Bank, have neglected the sector. The Bank's limited, and until recently declining, support to agriculture has not been strategically used to meet the diverse needs of a sector that requires coordinated interventions across a range of activities. Lending from the Bank has been sprinkled across various agricultural activities such as research, extension, credit, seeds, and policy reforms in rural space, but with insufficient recognition of the synergies among them. The Bank now has an opportunity, drawing on its comparative advantage as a multisector lending institution and as the single largest donor to African agriculture (during 1990-2005), to help ensure a coordinated and multifaceted approach to agriculture development in Africa.", ,Content Type : Reports,"August 6, 2007

The Ghanaian authorities were committed to the implementation of the PRSC's poverty-oriented goals, and the PRSC proved a useful instrument for providing resources, focus, and support for its implementation. The PRSC's priority sectors, particularly health and education, received significant resource increases during the PRSC period.

The problem of human resource development in Sub-Saharan Africa is examined through this study of the evolution of the Bank's local involvement and a review of selected issues in African education, technical assistance, and training efforts. Concerns have been raised that progress in overcoming these shortages has been slow, despite the substantial resources provided by local governments and international aid agencies during the past three decades. Research confirms that these concerns are justified. A number of policy options are considered - for example, making greater use of fee-for-service mechanisms to encourage better performance in education.

Both could have been more effective if they had been based on a broader dialogue. However, when these projects were designed--before the financial crisis of 1997--the government of Thailand was not interested in a broad program of Bank assistance. Lessons from these projects confirm that poverty reduction and natural resource management objectives can best be achieved through projects that are, indeed, part of a broader strategy for rural development.",Country :  Thailand,Content Type : Reports,"May 1, 1999

private sector development, and public sector reform. Overall, these weaknesses did little to promote the nascent economic recovery in the 1996-01 period. Future Bank assistance should focus on reviewing the HIPC program to ensure return to a sustainable external position. It should also focus on adjustment lending linked to measurable improvements in governance and public expenditure management, development of implementation capacity for sector-wide approaches, enhancing the multi-sectoral response to HIV/AIDS and providing analytic leadership in the area of social protection policy.",Country :  Zambia,Content Type : Reports,"September 17, 2002

Romania: Country Assistance Evaluation, PDF file,"This Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) examines the relevance and efficacy of World Bank assistance to Romania. It covers the period following the fall of the Ceausescu regime in December 1989 through 2004. Over this time, the key issue facing Romania gradually evolved from how to transition from a centrally planned to a free market economy, to how to transition from an as yet imperfectly operating market economy to European Union (EU) accession.The primary lessons from this evaluation are that adjustment lending is counterproductive when government commitment is lacking, while investment lending often does not bear fruit in a highly distorted policy environment. On the other hand, crisis situations can present a golden opportunity for reform, while contributions to institutional development through TA loans are part and parcel of successful adjustment assistance efforts.",Country :  Romania,Content Type : Reports,"May 25, 2005

Addressing administrative data gaps in India to fight COVID-19 (coronavirus) and speed recovery , Web Resource,"The authors work with CLEAR South Asia, hosted by Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), South Asia

As the world moves to ease restrictions imposed for COVID-19, it is increasingly clear that we will need to learn to live with the virus for some time and make significant behavioral changes. Governments have a difficult role to play in balancing public health concerns with economic needs and are grappling with questions related to how and what to open. Apart from these immediate challenges there is a need to hasten the economic recovery and build greater resilience to fight future pandemics.

India has made significant progress in the use of data to guide its strategies for coping with the impacts of the pandemic, a tool that will prove as useful for navigating the reopening. In view of its critical importance, CLEAR South Asia has been working with state governments in India to build capacity to collect and evaluate data better.

The COVID-19 pandemic, more than ever, has demonstrated the value of data in addressing public health crises. Researchers in the US analyzed anonymized cell phone location data to understand which enterprises can be ‘super spreaders’. India Observatory has developed a GIS-enabled dashboard to show the movement of migrants in real time and to identify relief centers on their routes. Moreover, governments are using data in different forms for contract tracing and isolation. Good quality data, particularly administrative data, can become a vital tool for governments to plan reopening and rebuilding the economy.

Administrative data, or admin data, which is data collected during routine transactions, can be a rich and inexpensive source of information to generate useful research, especially when data from different sources is combined (e.g. mobile signal data and incidence of disease) for easy use. However, in developing countries like India, there are significant challenges with regard to accessibility and usability of admin data, especially when government is the data provider, which limits its use. Access to admin data for research use in India is largely driven by individual champions rather than a comprehensive legal framework or protocols to govern access, storage, transfer and use in a transparent manner. In addition, there are constraints due to capacity and knowledge in making data available to researchers in a secure manner. For instance, ensuring a secure means of data transfer, determining sensitivity level of data fields, meta-data documentation, ability to anonymize data at source are a challenge for data providers, especially governments.

Another barrier, particularly for government generated admin data, is its usability in terms of appropriate formats, standardization of collection process and quality. Digitized data in PDF formats or at an aggregated level are not very useful for research purposes. Often, codes are not standardized even for basic geographical units (such as districts, villages) across datasets in India which makes combining datasets difficult. Another challenge is ascertaining data quality in regard to its reliability and accuracy.

Given the growing importance of data, the Indian government is increasingly aware of these gaps. A data protection bill is under consideration by the Parliament. The government released data protocols to address privacy concerns under its contract tracing application Arogya Setu. Moreover, NITI Aayog, a premier think tank of the Government of India, has recently launched its vision for the National Data and Analytics Platform (NADP) to address some issues around data usability. While most of these efforts are concentrated at the national level, there is also scope and demand for capacity building at the state level (federal units in India), where implementation takes place.

CLEAR South Asia has been working actively with state governments in India to address issues related to access and usability of government data (both primary and admin). We have conducted customized trainings and hands-on workshops for government staff on conducting independent data audits and quality checks. We have also provided advisory support to our government partners on their data policy, for transitioning to digital data collection and improving the data collection/recording process. In one such partnership, the CLEAR/ J-PAL South Asia team provided advisory inputs into the design of a new data collection system that the department was looking to transition to for recording complaints received on their women’s helpline. Our team also helped the government with more standardized formats for recording information in the interim.

Going forward, as CLEAR South Asia center, we plan to intensify our engagement with state governments and other data providers to demonstrate the potential of data use and in the process strengthen the access and usability of their admin data systems. Our team will ramp up efforts to provide customized capacity building workshops, and/or advisory services on how to make data more accessible for research, strengthening data collection processes, instituting systematic data quality checks as well as strengthening its use for decision-making to address specific needs and help in course correction.

Through these efforts, we hope to support the government’s increasing use of data to inform their decision-making process and as a foundation for rigorous evaluations. We hope that through these sustained efforts of CLEAR SA and our government stakeholders we can build better data systems to help recover and fight the next pandemic.

Zambia - First and Second Privatization and Industrial Reform Credits and Economic and Social Adjustment Credit, Web Resource,"The Ninth Power Project and Power
            Distribution and Transmission Project for Sri Lanka were
            rated marginally satisfactory. The projects achieved most of
            their objectives, their impact on institutional development
            was modest, sustainability is likely, and both the Bank and
            Borrower performed unsatisfactorily. Several lessons can be
            learned from these two projects. First, technical assistance
            and training is not sufficient to improve the institutional
            capacity of an agency that has overall administrative and
            incentive systems and high staff turnover. Second, projects
            need to give far more attention to the structure of tariffs
            rather than just its level. Third, financing agencies must
            be cautious when supporting only one agency in a sector.
            This can prevent an objective view of the weaknesses of the
            agency or other alternatives. Fourth, a high degree of donor
            coordination is needed in a sector where several agencies
            have attempted to strengthen the capacity of the key
            agencies over a long time and with limited success. Finally,
            the decision to seek a radically different institutional
            framework for the sector should be based on a thorough study
            of alternatives, an effective dialogue with government and
            all those with a stake in the sector, the development of a
            strategy to obtain the commitment of all stakeholders, and a
            strategic partnership with the other financing agencies involved. ",Country :  Zambia,Content Type : Reports,"April 28, 1998

Dominican Republic - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2006-09 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The FY2006-09 assistance strategy,
            which sought to support the government's program, had a
            cross-cutting focus on governance and institutional
            strengthening in the two pillars of the strategy: (i) to
            stabilize the economy, improve competitiveness, and restore
            economic growth; and (ii) to achieve greater social equity
            through human development and increased coverage and quality
            of basic public services. The review concludes that the
            assistance achieved some of its goals in both the pillars,
            but made little progress towards its cross-cutting goal of
            improving transparency and accountability in government. The
            Dominican Republic (DR) improved the quality of the
            organizations and institutions in the financial and health
            sectors and to a lesser extent in the electricity sector.
            Independent evaluation group (IEG) rated the outcome of the
            assistance moderately unsatisfactory. The following lessons
            and recommendations follow from the review: (i) the Bank
            needs to tailor its operations to fit the DR reality rather
            than rely on generic solutions under the guise of best
            international practices; (ii) when resources to prepare and
            supervise projects with ambitious goals are insufficient,
            the projects have problems during execution phase. To
            achieve the ambitious goals, the Bank must supply staff with
            the resources to prepare and supervise projects that can be
            delivered within the planned time frame; (iii) in the DR,
            the government demonstrates more commitment to addressing
            governance when measures are embedded in specific projects,
            suggesting that the Bank is more likely to achieve its goal
            if it addresses governance through specific interventions in
            its project lending; and (iv) economic and sector work (ESW)
            produced in English has little impact in the DR and the
            Bank's outreach effort is insufficient for ESW to have
            impact. The Bank should follow a consistent policy of
            translating its documents into Spanish. ",Country :  Dominican Republic,Content Type : Reports,"September 10, 2009

The original CPS period (FY14-17) was at the PLR stage extended by one year to cover FY14-18. The CLR and this review cover this extended period. Romania is an upper middle-income country with a GNI per capita of $9,480 in 2016 and a population of 19.7 million. Romania’s per capita GDP had grown rapidly up to 2009, reducing poverty, but the global financial crisis of 2008 triggered a severe recession. The IMF Article IV report (May 2017) notes that Romania strengthened its economy considerably after the global financial crisis. Romania registered an average annual GDP growth of 3.9 percent during the review period (2014-2016). Public debt and fiscal and current account imbalances are moderate compared to many emerging markets, but significant challenges remain and the momentum of progress in policies has waned. Income convergence with the EU has slowed and poverty is among the highest in the EU. Romania has a Human Development Index (HDI) of .802 in 2015, placing the country in the very high human development category and ranking 50 (of 188) in HDI in 2015. Its Gini coefficient is 28.3 in 2016 (from around 35 in 2010) and its poverty headcount ratio based on the national poverty line is 25.4 percent (average 2014-2016).",Country :  Romania,Content Type : Reports,"June 7, 2018

            1998-99 after Nigeria's peaceful transition from
            military rule. The government sought private sector led
            growth and identified corruption and governance as the
            proximate causes of the economic decline. The Bank's
            three objectives since 1999 were to: (1) improve governance
            and economic management, (2) support economic growth through
            private sector development, and (3) develop local
            communities through empowerment. Bank assistance included
            considerable economic and sector work and 19 IDA financed
            projects for US$1,545 million, but disbursements remain low
            and project implementation poor. The Strategy Completion
            Report (SCR) spans four interim strategy updates since 1999.
            The Bank's three objectives were relevant, but were not
            attained to any significant degree. There were improvements
            in governance and economic management at the federal level,

            commensurate with that at the federal level. Private sector
            development, consisting of privatization, removing
            infrastructure bottlenecks and promoting agriculture, was
            not achieved, although there was some privatization of state

Paraguay - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2004-08 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The FY04-07 Paraguay CAS was a
            re-engagement strategy for the Bank following a prolonged
            period of limited lending. The CAS proposed a substantial
            program of lending and AAA for FY04-07 and was subsequently
            extended through FY08. and was based on four objectives,
            well in line with the government strategy and focused on
            some of the most urgent issues in Paraguay: fiscal and
            financial stabilization, restoration of confidence in state
            institutions, support for the government's goal of
            sustainable growth, and assistance to expand coverage and
            efficiency of basic social services. The base case contained
            13 lending operations for FY04-07, for a total of US325
            million. Twenty-five percent of this total was for
            adjustment lending, which appeared adequate given the
            widespread need for structural and policy reforms. While the
            CAS was well-designed to address the key constraints to
            development in Paraguay, it was decidedly optimistic in view
            of the country's legacy of decades of dictatorship,
            followed by many years of political volatility, and given
            the experience with earlier CASs. The government has
            traditionally been sharply divided with contentious
            relationships between the Executive and Parliament,
            institutional capacity in government is low, and corruption
            is widespread.Only four projects materialized. Good progress
            was made towards the objective of stabilizing public
            finances and some progress towards strengthening the
            financial sector, primarily through adjustment lending, as
            well as towards the objective of laying the bases for
            sustainable growth, through Bank assistance for rural
            development, which led to local-level institution building
            to address major advances in agricultural and natural
            resource conservation practices. On the other hand, hardly
            any progress was made towards the other two CAS objectives:
            restoring confidence in state institutions, and expanding
            coverage and efficiency of basic social services. WBI
            indicators of governance suggest that little progress has
            been made over the past few years, while extreme poverty has
            increased. The Bank was clearly overly optimistic about the
            speed at which new laws could be enacted and reform could
            take place in the Paraguayan environment; or the rate at
            which the lending program could be delivered, given the
            eternal deadlock on reforms between the Executive and
            Congress, the government's weak institutional capacity
            and governance issues. The Bank's program of AAA was

Lesotho - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) for the period FY1998-FY2000 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The FY98 CAS period, initially
            FY1998-2000 was extended to FY2005 as contested elections in
            1998 led to political turmoil, a new government was elected
            only in 2002, and time was required to formulate a new
            program. The CAS objectives of poverty reduction and
            promoting integration into regional and world economies were
            consistent with the strategy of both the prior and current
            governments. The 2001 Lesotho Country Assistance Evaluation
            (CAE) evaluated implementation of the FY98 CAS through 2000.
            It evaluated the outcome of the Bank's assistance
            program as moderately unsatisfactory and noted shortfalls in
            Bank performance. The CAE recommended that World Bank
            assistance should continue to support reducing poverty and
            inequality by focusing on the quality of education and human
            capital development, combating HIV/AIDS, strengthening rural
            institutions, enhancing the enabling environment for private
            sector development, assisting Lesotho to improve its
            statistical database (most urgently in areas related to
            poverty reduction) and promote monitoring and evaluation
            systems. The main objectives of the 1998 CAS strategy were
            poverty reduction and closer economic integration with
            regional and global economies. This was consistent with the
            priorities of the government in power in 1998 as well as
            those priorities of the new government. The new
            government~^!!^s focus was refined with the PRSP as: (i)
            rapidly expanding employment through private-sector led
            economic growth; (ii) delivering poverty-targeted programs
            that empower poor and vulnerable people; and (iii) deepening
            democracy and improving public sector performance. ",Country :  Lesotho,Content Type : Reports,"April 12, 2006

Monitoring and Evaluation Capacity Development in Africa, PDF file,"A high-level seminar held in Abidjan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, in November 1998, brought together teams of senior officials from 12 African countries and 21 international development assistance agencies. Their task was to look at the current status--and help plan the future--of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity development in Africa. Participants acknowledged that M&E was once seen as primarily a donor activity, but no longer. A number of African countries--like their counterparts in Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean--are seeking to build national M&E capacity to realize its benefits within their own development agendas. The global trend toward more accountable, responsive, and efficient government has bolstered the appeal of M&E programs, as has their clear utility in supporting planned public sector reforms and maximizing the use of scarce resources.", ,Content Type : Reports,"May 1, 1999

Morocco - Urban Transport Sector Development Policy Loan Project, Web Resource ,"Rapid urbanization has imposed considerable pressure on Morocco's urban transport
systems. Public urban transport remains inadequate, deficient in quality, and functionally
disorganized, particularly in terms of bus-tramway integration in Rabat and Casablanca.
Intermodal transport is inefficient, as operators see themselves in competitive rather than
complementary roles. Traffic accidents and inadequate access to public transport have
disproportionately affected the poor, women and persons with limited mobility.
Morocco's urban mobility issues are partly the result of significant underinvestment in
the sector. Moreover, the lack of financial sustainability has hindered the participation of
new private operators, while current ones have been unable to renew their fleet or expand
services adequately to meet rapidly growing demand. Despite significant improvements,
the capacity to manage the urban transport sector still requires further strengthening,
particularly at the level of municipal authorities and their agglomerations.

Investing in evaluation capacity development in India: Why it matters now more than ever, Web Resource,"Governments around the world face the daunting task of addressing a downward spiral of economic activity coupled with a growing health burden from the spread of the coronavirus disease. India is no exception, and the government has had to be innovative in both designing policies and deploying resources to cope with the twin challenges.

We believe that two elements can be game-changers in addressing the crisis: the use of data and leveraging partnerships. For almost a decade, CLEAR South Asia has been collaborating with state governments in India to undertake systematic capacity-building efforts on data and evidence use for policy decision-making. 

Policymakers at the state and central levels have to lead the charge on developing data capacity and building strategic partnerships. They will need to think innovatively to respond swiftly to emerging challenges.

It has been gratifying to see the government’s creative use of real-time data and technology for planning containment strategies and service delivery.  We are also seeing an exciting mix of organizations, such as technology enablers, private companies, non-profits and research institutions complementing government efforts to tackle the most difficult challenges and protect the most vulnerable.

For these opportunities to be genuinely advantageous, the government must be able to collate and analyze data from multiple sources to understand fully the nature of problems confronting us and to respond effectively. Strengthened data capabilities of the government, whether independently or by leveraging partnerships, to interpret, absorb, and use data and evidence to make informed decisions are urgently needed.

However, system-level changes take time, and data use capabilities cannot be built overnight. The foundation of a systems change that is conducive and incentive-compatible for governments to internalize a data-driven approach needs to be laid in advance.

Creating sustainable channels

Leveraging our host institution J-PAL SA’s institutional partnership (now in its sixth year) with the state government of Tamil Nadu in India, CLEAR SA, in collaboration with the state bureaucracy, has developed and executed a multi-pronged, customized capacity-building strategy.  We engage with multiple levels of government to build capabilities across domains, using customized workshops, hands-on training, and advisory.

These efforts have culminated in structural channels that allow for useful feedback loops to inform decisions.  Our capacity-building approach had three key features:


	First, our long-term, government-wide partnership in Tamil Nadu is founded on a 360 degree, deeply embedded life-cycle approach which forges linkages between research, capacity building, and policy advisory to enable data use for decisions.
	Second, we now know that knowledge transfer is most effective when combined with live examples. Adoption is greater when demonstrated and allows for learning by doing. Multiple touchpoints and continued engagement have helped build trust and value, and sustain the commitment through elections, transfers of key personnel, and shifts in policy priorities.
	Third, we recognize that decision-making, especially on the adoption of new ideas or practices can be non-sequential– meaning that what we build and recommend today, could come to use a year or more later. A key strength is in being able to identify and be responsive to an opportunity whenever it emerges. In our experience, this is possible when the groundwork is laid upfront. Thus, when a policy window opens, the only incremental effort needed is to refresh and connect the dots, and not have to start from scratch. 


A longer-term systems-driven capacity-building approach can lead to increased sensitivity and reception to data-driven decision-making among governments.

Tamil Nadu is a good example, which has a substantial aging population, and their well-being is an important priority. The Department of Economics and Statistics, in collaboration with leading researchers, launched the first-ever state-wide elderly panel survey in 2016-17.  For almost four years, CLEAR SA provided technical advisory services and training workshops (mirroring activities on the project timeline) on sampling, questionnaire design, and data quality to enable rigorous and efficient data collection.

Our capacity-building efforts led to the adoption of independent backchecks (a standard practice in research) by the department to ensure the quality of data.  Last year, the department completed the baseline survey across five districts. Taking cognizance of a critical finding of a growing proportion of elderly living alone, the government announced in their latest budget, a pilot intervention of elderly daycare centers in the state. In addition to these policy wins, the department also adopted digital data collection for their surveys and plan to conduct a follow-up wave next year.

We are now planning an evaluation of this pilot to inform expansion approaches. Further, during the current crisis, via the use of phone surveys, the government and researchers can track whether the elderly covered in the survey are facing any issues during the Covid-19 lockdown.  

Such a holistic, long-term, and embedded approach was instrumental in creating systems for new and high-quality data collection, use of data for planning, decisions, and increased appetite for further evaluations. It also means that the goal of adopting a systematic approach to designing innovative policies and deploying resources to protect a vulnerable population such as the elderly, is achievable.

Although assistance from the International Development Agency (IDA) has become more relevant and has had a greater macroeconomic impact in recent years, there is considerable room for improvement. Before 1995, IDA lending to Yemen was limited, primarily because of political and economic instability, and the results were modest. Since 1996, IDA assistance has increased in scale and scope.

India - Country assistance strategy (CAS) completion report review : IEG review, Web Resource,"In the late 1990s the Bank adopted a
            strategy in India that focused on supporting reform at the
            level of the State Governments. The essence of the strategy
            was to identify a group of willing reformers i.e. State
            Governments that had indicated their intention to reduce
            fiscal deficits and improve the quality of their public
            expenditures, including increasing the allocations for
            development and social programs, and provide these
            'focus states' with a package of development
            policy loans (DPLs), technical assistance and analytic work,
            and investment loans for infrastructure and the social
            sectors. Three states, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar
            Pradesh were selected as the initial batch of focus states.
            The hope was that other states, particularly some of the
            lagging ones, would be persuaded by successful outcomes in
            these focus states to join the program. Reduction of fiscal
            deficits at the state level was high on the list of
            priorities of the Federal Government, which agreed, for the
            first time, to the Bank providing DPLs to State Governments.
            By 2002-03 it was becoming clear that the approach had
            serious limitations. Some of the original focus states had
            not followed through on their intentions to reform, and,
            except for Tamil Nadu no other states had been persuaded to
            adopt reformist policies in order to secure Bank support.
            The FY05 CAS was written against this background. It
            advocated a major shift in the strategy to allow the Bank to
            engage more broadly with India's 12 poorest states. In
            particular more resources were to be devoted to the four
            poorest states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and Uttar
            Pradesh, regardless of performance. This was to be
            complemented through greater support at the National level.
            India's central government was increasingly making use
            of federally sponsored programs with earmarked funding to
            promote objectives at the State level, and these were seen
            as suitable vehicles for Bank support as well. ",Country :  India,Content Type : Reports,"November 24, 2008

            rather than accelerated reforms, especially to the civil

Global Program Review: Global Water Partnership, PDF file,"The Global Water Partnership (GWP) was established by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), the United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank in 1996 in response to international concerns about deteriorating fresh water resources. Its mission has been to support countries in the sustainable management of their water resources through an advocacy network based on the principles of integrated water resources management (IWRM). The GWP functioned as a unit of SIDA until July 2002. Then it became an independent intergovernmental organization under international law known as the Global Water Partnership Organization (GWPO), which provides support to the network â now comprising more than 2,100 individual partners that have grouped themselves in regional, country, and area water partnerships. A joint donor group led by the U.K. Department for International Development commissioned an evaluation of the GWP at the end of its 2004â08 strategy period. This evaluation found that GWP's global policy leadership continued to be recognized, especially in facilitating multi-stakeholder dialogues on IWRM. Major growth occurred at the country level, with the maturing of country partnerships, the development of national IWRM plans, and the facilitation of bilateral funding to support IWRM initiatives, although the GWP did not achieve the ambitious targets it had set in 2004. More time is clearly needed for IWRM to take root. The present review found that the GWP is generally rising to the many challenges in governing and managing a global advocacy and knowledge network. The World Bank was one of the three founding partners of the GWP in 1996, contributing $5.7 million from 1996 to 2002, and it remains one of the 10 sponsoring partners. In spite of the Bank's continuing legal responsibility to contribute to GWP's governance, the review found that the Bank has effectively been a silent partner since it stopped contributing financially in 2003. The Bank needs to clearly establish its pos ition among the sponsoring partners in the GWP to avoid raising false expectations and risk. The GWP, in turn, would welcome strengthened collaboration with the World Bank on IWRM at global, regional, and country levels as a means of enhancing the quality and sustainability of investments in the water sector.", ,Content Type : Reports,"August 1, 2010

Philippines - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2006-09 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The FY06-08 CAS was in support of the
            2004-2010 Medium Term Philippines Development Plan (MTPDP).
            The CAS was focused on four objectives which were an
            integral part of the MTPDP: (i) improvements in governance
            and in (ii) fiscal stability, which in turn were needed for
            (iii) sustained growth and (iv) social inclusion. Each of
            the four objectives would be pursued at three levels:
            national, local government unit (LGU), and private sector.
            Thus, the results framework contained a total of twelve
            outcomes. Project proposals and AAA were presented as a menu
            from which to choose, as circumstances developed. The Bank
            aligned its strategy closely to that of the Philippine
            government, increased its lending level appropriately as the
            fiscal situation improved, and responded flexibly, including
            through development policy lending, to crises. The
            Bank's economic analyses are much appreciated and serve
            as the essential background for the deliberations of the
            Philippines Development Forum. Of the fifteen projects on
            the menu in the CAS five materialized, all at the national
            level. The bulk was in response to government demands to
            shift from pure investment lending to national program
            support (sector wide approaches). The prime focus was on
            institutional development in the different sectors. Of four
            additional projects not in the CAS, one was focused on LGUs.
            The most visible and probably most effective contribution of
            the Bank's AAA was the background material, including
            regular country economic reports, prepared for the
            Philippine Development Forum (PDF), a consultative group
            meeting with a wide variety of stakeholders, including civil
            society, congress and the business community. In the area of
            ""improvements in governance"", the Bank has made
            small contributions in such areas as budget and procurement
            reform, but with little visible impact on governance at the
            country level as a whole. In terms of ""improved fiscal
            performance"" the Bank contributed to a significant
            positive turnaround as well as to improved financial
            performance of public enterprises. The consolidated public
            sector balance improved from the equivalent of -4.8 percent
            of GDP in 2004 to 1.4 percent in 2007. In the area of
            ""sustained growth and increased competitiveness"",
            Bank contributions to infrastructure, in close cooperation
            with IFC especially in the power sector, were significant,
            yet the overall investment ratio continued to fall and there
            is no evidence of increases in productivity. Poverty
            increased from 30 percent in 2003 to 32.9 percent in 2006.
            In terms of ""increased social inclusion"" there is
            little evidence of improvement. On balance, IEG rates the
            overall outcome of Bank assistance to the Philippines as
            moderately satisfactory. ",Country :  Philippines,Content Type : Reports,"April 13, 2009

Bolivia - Environmental Technical Assistance Project, Web Resource,"The project outcome is rated as
            marginally unsatisfactory, with sustainability as unlikely,
            and institutional development impact as modest. Both
            borrower and World Bank performances are rated as
            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned highlight the importance of
            retaining expensively trained personnel, transparency in
            hiring, and clarity in procurement terms-of-reference. When
            core positions are filled with consultants earning higher
            salaries than their peers, it limits the project's
            sustainability, leads to inequalities between staff
            performing the same services, and contributes to a poor
            retention rate. The issue should have been addressed during
            project preparation, with the government agreeing on a clear
            policy on salary, to be stipulated in the legal agreement.
            There is a need for an autonomous civil service, until some
            other mechanism is developed to guarantee key staff some
            sort of reasonable tenure. Projects suffer when they are
            designed under one government and executed under a
            subsequent one whose structure and priorities are distinctly
            different. Unless an institution clearly has government
            support, it is unlikely to improve no matter what level of
            ""institutional strengthening"" is provided.
            Projects should be designed which give local nongovernmental
            organizations further opportunities to participate.
            Government supervision was deficient; terms of reference

It looks at the Bank's contribution to the achievement of those outcomes and the lessons for the Bank's future activities both in Turkey and more broadly. The evaluation finds that the Bank's strategy during the period under review was broadly appropriate. The constraint which macro-instability represented for sustainable growth and poverty reduction required a focus on fiscal restructuring and increasing the efficiency of the public sector. While it remains essential that the Bank program covers these areas, including particularly capacities in line ministries to deliver services more effectively, a move to a more balanced approach is now appropriate. Looking forward the Bank needs to strengthen its analysis and support for (a) improvements in the investment climate, including governance and labor markets, and (b) improved environmental management.",Country :  Turkey,Content Type : Reports,"February 13, 2006

Poverty Reduction Support Credits: Benin Country Study (Working Paper), PDF file,"This working paper on  Poverty Reduction Support Credits: Benin Country Study is one of a series of seven background country case studies, prepared for the IEG evaluation of the World Bank's support for Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs). Between 1989 and 2002, Benin benefited from support under three Structural Adjustment Loans/Credits (SALs) and a Public Expenditure Reform Adjustment Credit (PERAC) and supplemental credit. In 2004 Benin moved to consolidated support under the Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) program. The PRSCs have clearly had a beneficial impact on improving government policy dialogue. Policy makers in technical ministries reported they were aware of Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper goals and mechanisms and believed, to varying degrees, that the PRSC process helped them strengthen the operational focus of their sector strategies and programs. The PRSCs have contributed significantly to donor harmonization, with the Bank receiving
praise for its open, participatory processes and inclusiveness.",Country :  Benin,Content Type : Reports,"September 1, 2010

"Seven Findings for the Nexus of Infrastructure, Agriculture, and the Environment", PDF file,"Development thinking has come in waves. The emphasis has shifted from infrastructure, to agriculture, to the macro economy, to human development. There is renewed interest in infrastructure and agriculture
at the World Bank, following a decline in lending to these sectors during the 1990s. Although this decline is now being reversed, the application of the lessons of experience, such as neglect of environmental sustainability, will contribute to better results. Experience shows that countrywide reforms can accelerate development. Furthermore, progress in one area positively influences other areas. For example, improved health contributes to better learning outcomes, and vice versa. There are also common lessons across sectors on the role of government. This brief clarifies the degree of variations in lending. It then focuses on seven findings that are crucial to the Bank's interest in supporting infrastructure and agriculture, together with concern for the environment. These findings draw primarily on recent evaluations by the
Independent Evaluation Group, but they resonate with findings from other sources as well. Many of these findings have influenced Bank policy and operations.", ,Content Type : Reports,"August 31, 2006

Tunisia Country Assistance Evaluation (Reach), PDF file,"Tunisia has made remarkable socioeconomic progress. Real per capita incomes expanded, poverty rates declined, and social indicators improved. Since 1990 World Bank assistance has supported stabilization and structural reform. The Bank program successfully promoted reforms in the financial, external, rural, and private sectors. The Bank's increased focus on the social sectors was aligned with the MDGs, and Tunisia made excellent social progress. The Bank's overall assistance program had a satisfactory outcome. Islamic Development Bank (IDB) assistance contributed to the development of key sectors: public utilities, and agriculture and rural development. The evaluation points to shortfalls that pose risks to sustained development progress, in light of heightened international competition, and offers joint recommendations: help the government improve the environment for private investment; enhance the efficiency and quality of social spending; and strengthen institutions and safety nets in the rural sector. Good quality analytical studies should inform future assistance programs.",Country :  Tunisia,Content Type : Reports,"August 30, 2004

Bulgaria - Water Companies Restructuring and Modernization Project, Web Resource ,"This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Water Companies Restructuring and Modernization Project, estimated (at appraisal) to cost US$131.0 million. The project was approved in May 1994 for an IBRD loan of US$98.0 million that covered 74.8 percent of the total costs. The Government of Bulgaria (GOB) covered US$11.4 million (8.7 percent), and participating water companies US$21.6 million (16.5 percent). In April 1997, the project was restructured after the GOB requested the cancellation of US$41.0 million of the loan due to a serious economic setback that made the loan unaffordable. In the process, a district heating component costing US$17.1 million was added to the project with an allocation of US$12.0 million of the loan. US$45.0 million (of the reduced loan of US$57.0 million) was earmarked for the original water supply and sewerage components.

Malawi: Nutrition and HIV/AIDS Project (PPAR), PDF file,"This report focuses on lessons learned from the International Development Association’s (IDA) support to maternal and child health and nutrition under the Malawi Nutrition and HIV/AIDS Project. At the time of project approval, Malawi had made substantial gains in reducing the prevalence of underweight children. However, chronic undernutrition remained high—47 percent of Malawi’s children under the age of five were stunted, exceeding the Sub-Saharan Africa average of 40 percent. The underlying causes of malnutrition included poverty, nutrition-deficient household behaviors, inadequate food preparation, and care practices. The government of Malawi’s response to chronic high malnutrition rates began in 2004,

when it created the Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS (DNHA) and implemented a nutrition policy. The Nutrition and HIV/AIDS Project (the project) was approved in 2012 and financed through an International Development Association credit ($32 million) and an International Development Association grant ($26 million). The project development objective was “to increase access to and utilization of selected services known to contribute to the reduction of stunted growth, maternal and child anemia, and the prevention of HIV and AIDS in children and sexually active adults.” 

Ratings for the Nutrition and HIV/AIDS Project are as follows: Outcome was moderately unsatisfactory, Overall efficacy was modest, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Quality of monitoring and evaluation were modest/negligible. This assessment offers the following five lessons and recommendations: (i) While the care group model might be a viable option for nutrition communication and potential behavior change, it is critical to focus on the conditions that can make the model successful. (ii) Developing community-based activities at a large scale takes time and continuous support and it is fundamental to adequately estimate the time and resources needed for full implementation. (iii) The care group model requires intensive stakeholder engagement and sensitivity to the social context. (iv) To track output delivery and expected change, the PDO, results framework, and indicators need to be well tailored. (v) Project structures that are sufficiently flexible to adjust to donor and government needs, help implementation and achievement of results In the HIV/AIDS component, the project adeptly responded to shifts in donor funding commitments to ensure efficient deployment of project resources in needed areas.

Gabon - Country assistance strategy (CAS) completion report review, Web Resource,"The World Bank's objective in
            Gabon was focused on poverty alleviation, with the Bank
            assuming mostly the role of 'Knowledge Bank.' The
            role was ambitious given the limited resources available to
            the Country Unit and the lack of commitment within the
            Government to address poverty. Implementation of the CAS has
            been deficient. The Bank was absent from the social sectors
            for most of the period under review due to a shift of
            priority within the Country Director 3 office, high turnover
            in staff and a two year vacancy in the country office (until
            FY03). The planned analytical work was not carried out or
            not followed-up on. The two suggested lending operations did
            not materialize due to lack of progress with the
            privatization of the Railway and disagreements between the
            Bank and the Government over the scope of the suggested
            Public Sector Reform Project. The thrust of the
            implementation was thus on supporting macroeconomic
            stability and on the four loans already under implementation
            in 1998. The Bank needs to clearly define its role in Gabon,
            reach agreement on priorities with the Government and
            allocate resources accordingly. ",Country :  Gabon,Content Type : Reports,"May 16, 2005

At the outset of the FY05-08 CAS program, Cambodia was one of the world's poorest
economies in the world with a per-capita income of about US$460--Gross National Income in current
US$--and a high incidence of poverty. It had a difficult legacy of warfare, genocide, and physical
devastation. Social indicators were among the lowest for all developing countries. Close to 85 percent
of the population, and 90 percent of the poor, lived in rural areas, making rural development an
essential ingredient of poverty alleviation. The infant mortality rate of the lowest income quintile was
156 per 1,000, and the poverty headcount was more than 50 percent.

Rwanda - Country assistance strategy (CAS) completion report review : IEG review, Web Resource,"This review covers both the FY03-05
            country assistance strategy (CAS) (extended to FY06) and the
            FY06-08 Interim Strategy Note (ISN), as does the CAS
            completion report (CR), and refers to the two documents
            together as the FY03 CAS, unless otherwise specified. The
            FY03 CAS sought to assist land-locked Rwanda to overcome the
            legacy of civil war, genocide, and cross-border war which
            left it with a per capita income of only US$210 in 2002,
            compared to US$370 in 1990. Its objectives were: (a)
            revitalization of the rural economy; (b) private sector
            development and employment creation; and (c) human and
            social development. However, these were reformulated into a
            five objective program for purposes of defining triggers and
            monitoring indicators and otherwise developing the
            particulars of the program. This formulation is maintained
            in the CASCR and so is also maintained in the CASCR review,
            namely: (1) mainstream poverty reduction; (2) revitalize the
            rural economy; (3) develop the private sector and create
            employment; (4) support human and social development; and
            (5) improve the effectiveness of public sector actions and
            governance, consistent with the government's Poverty
            Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). A sixth objective
            concerning national reconciliation, security, and
            governance, was presented in the FY03 CAS matrix but is not
            considered a full component since its program was small and
            substantially included in other objectives. The ISN also
            presents the three main objectives as in the CAS but then
            also reverts to the five objective formulations for
            presenting the particulars of the program. While overall CAS
            goals were ambitious, the lending program was realistic,
            although analytical and advisory assistance (AAA) was
            modified substantially in implementation especially to
            better assist government in improving financial management. ", ,Content Type : Reports,"September 8, 2008

Bangladesh - Country assistance strategy (CAS) completion report review, Web Resource,"The 2001-2004 CAS focused on five
            objectives: accelerating broad-based growth; consolidating
            gains in human development; formulating and implementing an
            integrated approach to rural development; building stronger
            institutions and improving governance; and addressing
            environmental management and gender disparities. IDA moved
            from low case lending of $250-300 million per annum at the
            outset to base case lending of $450-500 million p.a. by the
            middle of the CAS period. This was done by meeting the
            triggers set for economic reform, which in turn enabled the
            resumption of policy-based lending. The CAS Completion
            Report (CASCR) comprehensively analyzes the effectiveness of
            IDA's program. The CASCR is candid on the strengths and
            weaknesses of the program and its outcomes. The FY01 CAS was
            not a results-based document, although the CASCR attempted
            to provide progress on several 'retrofitted' CAS
            outcomes. It should also be noted that the CASCR was
            completed in October 2004, thus only covering until
            end-FY04. Further progress on governance, and support under
            the recently approved third development support credit was
            not reflected in the CASCR. As the CASCR notes, the lending
            strategy distinguished the key economic and infrastructure
            sectors from the social sectors. Assistance to the former
            required up-front demonstration of reforms, while assistance
            to the latter could proceed alongside parallel reforms.
            Thus, Bank involvement in sectors such as public
            administration, banking, and energy were linked to CAS
            triggers that required a roadmap for reform. There was an
            understanding that governance and structural issues would be
            tackled in all of the major reform areas. However, lending
            in health and education could be provided without waiting
            (as a pre-condition) for reforms, due to the Bank's
            commitment to help meet critical poverty reduction needs.
            This was a good specification o f a two-track approach, and
            justified given the lack of full government commitment to
            reform across all sectors and perseverance of social issues. ",Country :  Bangladesh,Content Type : Reports,"February 22, 2006

Tajikistan - Country assistance strategy (CAS) completion report review, Web Resource,"The CAS Completion Report (CASCR) for
            Tajikistan finds that there has been substantial economic
            growth (the second objective), and little progress towards
            the others (improving social service delivery and
            strengthening institutions for a market economy). This
            growth and large worker remittances significantly reduced
            poverty, a creditable outcome considering the difficult
            country conditions and poor governance. Bank activities
            usefully contributed to this outcome: For example, they
            helped reduce hindrances on remittances through banks,
            economic and sector work (ESW), analyzed important sectors
            like cotton, and projects helped improve policies and some
            infrastructure. OED finds the outcome of Bank assistance to
            be moderately satisfactory. Lessons and findings discussed
            include the following: Tajikistan illustrates how
            substantial foreign aid complicates development; the
            government muted its reservations to some approaches and
            projects favored by donors--despite substantial
            participation in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Aid
            makes the Bank's task more difficult and important; the
            Bank must not only discern what the authorities want, but
            must also divine what the country needs, and reconcile the
            two when they differ. The primary lesson from this
            experience is the importance of country specific and timely
            ESW that informs policy makers and guides projects. For
            example, ESW found that cotton debts resulted from
            precluding competition for inputs, outputs, and credit--not
            because cotton was unproductive as the government claimed.
            Other ESW (some regional) on poverty, irrigation,
            electricity, etc., were also useful, but there was little
            work of similar quality in industry and in banking. The
            second lesson is for the Bank and government to agree on
            specific steps, not just on broad objectives. Agreement on
            specific projects and their design would have made it easier
            for the Bank to help the country reap the potentially large
            efficiency gains in sectors such as cotton, and the savings
            that such growth generates could finance development. ",Country :  Tajikistan,Content Type : Reports,"July 14, 2005

            follows: (i) enhance macro-fiscal stability, setting the
            foundation for renewed growth; and (ii) improve
            competitiveness and private sector development. During the
            CPS period, the Bank Group showed flexibility and responded
            to changes in country conditions, macro fiscal developments,
            and government priorities by refocusing the program and
            dropping several planned interventions. The completion and
            learning review (CLR) highlighted six lessons. Independent
            evaluation group (IEG) adds the following lessons: (i)
            effective use of the performance and learning review (PLR)
            is crucial in the face of evolving country contexts and
            government priorities; and (ii) a focused assessment of
            likely areas attractive for private investment may be
            appropriate, and the government will have to cede space
            convincingly for private operators to enter key sectors. ", ,Content Type : Reports,"October 17, 2019

Kenya - Third and Fourth Population Projects, Web Resource,"The audit ratings for both the Third,
            and Fourth Population Project assess unsatisfactory
            outcomes, unlikely sustainability, and negligible
            institutional development impacts. Failure to achieve
            development impacts, despite extensive training investments
            to strengthen the National Council for Population and
            Development, and major procurement constraints, were
            conducive to the projects' unsuccessful results,
            aggravated by systemic constraints in Borrower payments, and
            financial management systems, which constrained counterpart
            funds. Among the many lessons drawn from the projects, it is
            demonstrated that the Bank's own control, and
            accountability systems allow for breakdowns, which include
            failures in staff changes, as well as failures in management
            enforcement of Bank operating procedures, and minimal
            standards of accountability for project funds. Hence, it is
            suggested that although improving governance in Kenya is
            appropriate, its credibility require, if any, higher
            standards in Bank operations, and staff. Nonetheless,
            subsequent Bank management addressed implementation
            problems, a fact appreciated by government officials,
            enabling responsiveness to performance targets, and a
            proactive supervision. Yet, and although governance still
            require strong political power, it is recognized that

Colombia - Second Rural Roads Sector Project and Third National Highway Sector Project, Web Resource,"The outcome of the two projects is
            rated satisfactory. Institutional development impact is
            rated modest in the rural project and substantial in the
            national project. Sustainability is rated uncertain in both
            projects, mainly because the reforms are still not
            completed, the financial and technical capacity of the
            regional governments to take over remains an issue, and
            there has been some deterioration in road maintenance since
            the projects' completion. The audit acknowledges,
            however, that the creation of the National Institute of
            Highways, and the way its scope and functions are defined is
            a notable achievement that has the potential to greatly
            improve efficiency in the highway sector over the long-term.
            World Bank performance is rated satisfactory in both
            projects. These ratings are broadly consistent with those of
            the implementation completion reports. These were the major
            lessons learned: Major highway management reforms are more
            likely to succeed under a good economic climate. The
            implementation risks posed by a large number of sub-projects
            and contracts are difficult if not impossible to mitigate.
            The devolution of responsibility for roads to local
            governments requires a detailed assessment of the ownership
            and financial and technical capacities of the receiving
            government. Benefits of organizational structure need to be

Poland - Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan Project, Web Resource,"The project rating is highly
            satisfactory, because, despite its shortcomings, the project
            achieved its main objectives, and laid the foundation for a
            robust financial sector. Sustainability is likely, in light
            of the positive privatization process of commercial banks,
            the improved management, and governance of the banking, and
            enterprise sectors, and, Poland's progress towards
            joining the European Union, proves that the reforms achieved
            under the project, will be sustained. The lessons reinforce
            once again, the value of participatory processes. The
            initial concept of the project - conducted in coordination
            between the Bank, and the Government - was entirely
            different to the eventual design: linking bank
            recapitalization to enterprise restructuring, proposed by
            innovative Polish Government officials, became the core
            concept in what proved to be a successful operation. The
            comprehensive approach in addressing the insolvency problems
            of state-owned commercial banks' loans, was
            instrumental in improving credit assessment, and risk
            control systems. This ensured the success of bank
            recapitalization, in addition to the careful sequencing of
            events, which required that bank recapitalization be started
            following prerequisites for bank practices. Legal documents
            should contain precise conditionalities, to avoid mandate
            failures of loan covenants, particularly on privatization issues. ",Country :  Poland,Content Type : Reports,"March 27, 2000

Uganda - First and Second Structural Adjustment Credit Projects, Web Resource,"This report rates the First
            Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC1) as highly satisfactory,
            based on its relevance, high efficacy and fully satisfactory
            cost-effectiveness, and, the Second Structural Adjustment
            Credit (SAC2) as satisfactory, less relevant, and, although
            high efficacy was achieved, its cost-effectiveness was just
            satisfactory. Considering whether the high rating is
            appropriate, it is important to emphasize that, upon
            approval of the SAC1, the Government was just becoming
            functional, and where it was found to be
            ""functional"" - coffee marketing and enforcing
            counterproductive controls - was indeed, dysfunctional.
            Nevertheless, against a climate where inflation is high,
            investments are poor, and budget processes weak, it is
            remarkable that progress on critical fronts, such as trade
            policy/incentive system and custodian board, was
            substantial, and worthy of a high rating. Among the lessons
            learned, the report suggest that SACs' considerable
            influence, should focus on policy reforms, for adjustment is
            a long strategic process. Furthermore, the incidence and
            quality of government service should be an integral
            monitoring factor, for this very factor, may provide the
            insights for governments to re-engineer themselves. While

Ratings for the project are as follows: Outcome was highly satisfactory, Risk to development was low, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. The main lessons that emerge from the experience of this complex project are: (i) Combining institutional development and investments in one package can help overcome difficult challenges. (ii) Adequate time and resources for preparation and consultations should be planned and allowed. (iii) Cost-shared grants can enhance selectivity and efficiently leverage knowledge transfer, technology improvement, and counterpart funding. (iv) A long-term, predictable price signal can provide an effective stimulus for continuing investments in renewable energies.

This is an Approach Paper for the upcomgin evaluation on World Bank Group's Response to the Global Food Crisis, which describes the scope, objectives and methodology of the evaluation. 
The purpose of the evaluation is to review and evaluate the immediate responses of the Bank Group to the global food crisis of 2007-08, as well as to assess progress in building up resilience to future crises through the Bank's regular lending program and Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) activities. Building up resilience, is conceptually closely related to food security. It corresponds to the  availability and, in part, to
the access aspects of food security, in the sense that increased agricultural productive capacity improves the availability of food, while improved safety net infrastructure enables governments to expand vulnerable households' access to food in times of crisis through cash

IFC in Indonesia: An Independent Country Impact Review, PDF file,"IEGâs Country Impact Review (CIR) evaluates IFCâs strategies and operations, and their outcome drivers in Indonesia, during fiscal year (FY) 1990-2006. The CIRâs main messages are: 1) while IFC's strategic priorities in Indonesia have been aligned with the country's private sector development needs, it has made little progress in supporting a larger private sector role in infrastructure and in helping deepen the financial markets. Increased private sector participation and IFC support for infrastructure development and for deepening the financial markets will depend on further government reforms. The CIR calls for a stronger IFC role in infrastructure and capital market development, including by strategically and operationally partnering with the World Bank and other multilateral development banks to help dovetail sector reforms and investments. 2) IFC needs to strengthen the environmental supervision of its Indonesian projects. The current compliance rate on environmental aspects is significantly below the institutional average and should be improved.

A Review of the Literature on Participatory Approaches to Local Development for an Evaluation of the Effectiveness of World Bank Support for Community-Based and Driven Development Approaches, PDF file,"This paper explores the available literature on participatory approaches to development as an input to the OED evaluation of World Bank-supported community-based development (CBD) and community-driven development (CDD) interventions. Participatory approaches to development have gained substantial support in the international community over the past quarter century, and have become increasingly important in the work of the World Bank and other donors. The evidence from the literature on community participation points to a âdouble exclusion' of weaker social groups from decision-making fora. Exclusionary membership norms, the considerable opportunity costs and the eagerness of the local elite to control new sources of power and patronage often means that participants are relatively better-off. Moreover, weaker social groups tend not to speak up against the views expressed by more powerful members of the community, and their voices can be easily silenced by better-educated and more powerful participants. The literature on participatory governance points to a greater level of formal inclusion of hitherto excluded citizens, but similar low levels of substantive inclusion.", ,Content Type : Reports,"November 17, 2005

Burkina Faso - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2006-09 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The FY2006-09 country assistance
            strategy (CAS) was aligned with Burkina Faso's poverty
            reduction strategy, supporting four pillars: accelerated and
            shared growth, access to basic social services, employment,
            and governance. CAS implementation was supported by total
            commitments of 835.2 million dollars covering 22 projects
            and programs, including six non-programmed ones. This total
            exceeded the base case lending envelope. The Bank scaled up
            ongoing projects (education and urban water and sanitation)
            and responded to unforeseen external factors, including
            climatic shocks, food and fuel price increases, a cotton
            price decline, regional instability, and the global economic
            downturn. International Development Association's
            (IDA's) lending was supported by five completed
            non-lending products and seven under way, including three
            unplanned products. IDA's program was for the most part
            successful in achieving the objectives stated in the CAS and
            independent evaluation group (IEG) rated the overall outcome
            as moderately satisfactory. The lesson of this review is
            that the objectives of the Bank support for decentralization
            need to be realistic, taking into account the complexities
            of inter-governmental transfers, weak budget autonomy of
            local governments, lack of clarity in the responsibilities
            of local and central governments, and inadequate public oversight. ",Country :  Burkina Faso,Content Type : Reports,"August 31, 2009

"Bulgaria - The Rehabilitation Loan Project, the Critical Imports Rehabilitation Loan (CIRL) Project, and the First and Second Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan Projects (FESAL I and FESAL II)", Web Resource,"This PPAR rates the outcome of the
            Rehabilitation Loan as unsatisfactory, but rates the outome
            of the CIRL and FESAL I as satisfactory. The outome of FESAL
            II is rated as moderately satisfactory. The report rates
            sustainability of the Rehabilitation Loan as highly
            unlikely, while project sustainability of the CIRL, FESAL I,
            and FESAL II is assessed as likely. Institutional
            Development Impact of the Rehabilitation Loan is rated as
            negligible, of CIRL, modest, of FESAL I, substantial, and of
            FESAL II, as modest. Five OED lessons were confirmed by the
            experience of these projects. First, the difference that
            ownership and commitment to the program makes is
            dramatically demonstrated by the contrast between the
            unsuccessful Rehabilitation Loan, which was pursued absent
            any realistic indication of government commitment, and the
            CIRL and FESAL I and II which were pursued in support of a
            fully credible government reform program. Second, the Bank
            needs to pursue complementary reforms in a realistic and
            timely fashion. The absence of agreed programs covering a
            range of aspects such as governance and judicial reforms has
            circumscribed the achievements of the FESALs and limited the
            benefits they provided to the economy. Third, the Bank
            should pay close attention to the form of privatization and
            any constraints which may be imposed on privatized
            enterprises. Fourth, the Bank needs to pay attention to
            management continuity. Finally, partnerships can play
            valuable roles. ",Country :  Bulgaria,Content Type : Reports,"October 30, 2001

Zambia - Transport Engineering and Technical Assistance Project, Web Resource,"The audit fully concurs with the
            Implementation Completion Report's assessment of
            satisfactory outcome, likely sustainability, and substantial
            institutional development. The experience of the project
            confirms a number of lessons: 1) if a government is capable
            of passing institutional, and policy reforms, - without
            using the political process - it may well reverse those
            reforms without deliberation. While the Road Fund, and Roads
            Board were effectively established, using the
            government's discretionary power - without involving
            the legislative branch - this in fact, leaves both of them
            vulnerable to dissolution by the same processes; 2)
            fragmented institutional arrangements decrease the returns
            from institutional development efforts, since the efficacy
            of organizational strengthening, is limited by the
            institutional organization of the sector; 3) regardless of
            the sustained, and stable resources a Road Fund can provide
            for road maintenance, its sustainability depends on limiting
            the government's ability to use the fund for other
            purposes, on having broad-based revenue sources, and, on the
            process of direct deposits of fuel levies to the Road Fund
            account, to avoid transfers delays, in addition to an active
            stakeholder participation; and, 4) whereas private sector
            participation in road maintenance can provide substantial
            benefits, these can only be sustained if the road agencies
            can develop contracting capacity. ",Country :  Zambia,Content Type : Reports,"June 27, 2001

India - Private Power Utilities (BSES) Product, Web Resource,"The project's overall outcome
            rating was downgraded to marginally satisfactory because of
            the negative environmental impact on the surrounding
            wetlands, which was not identified at the time of appraisal.
            Although the audit rates the Borrower's (BSES)
            performance as satisfactory, it notes that the performance
            of the government of Maharashtra was less than satisfactory
            in the critical area of environmental supervision and
            reporting. OED rates the World Bank's overall
            performance as satisfactory, although it notes that the Bank
            should have taken more care to identify the wetlands issue
            at appraisal and to follow up with BSES on the Bank's
            environmental standards for plant operation during the
            implementation completion review mission. Major lessons from
            this project are: The Bank's policy of supervising
            projects only until the loan is fully disbursed and closed
            is inadequate to confirm continued compliance with the
            Bank's environmental guidelines. Agreement should be
            reached during the appraisal process on environmental
            monitoring data to be collected, verified by an independent
            environmental agency, and submitted to the Bank during the
            project's operational phase. Proposals for future
            actions that appear environmentally attractive should be
            realistic and economically viable. The Bank should make
            implementation of environmental agreements a central issue
            with national and local governments, and avoid lending where
            governments have not fulfilled their existing obligations. ",Country :  India,Content Type : Reports,"June 29, 1999

Ghana - Fifth Power Project, Web Resource,"The project outcome is rated as
            marginally unsatisfactory. The audit assesses the
            institutional development impact of the project to have been
            modest and its sustainability to be uncertain, given weak
            sector finances. The World Bank performance is rated as
            unsatisfactory because the project design did not include
            specific customer management improvements essential to
            reduce unrecorded consumption and because the Bank was too
            reluctant to exercise remedies in the face of the
            government's prolonged and significant non-compliance
            with critical financial covenants. Borrower performance is
            rated unsatisfactory because the government refused to
            implement tariff increases during a period of
            hyperinflation, causing large financial losses to the sector
            entities and obliging itself to bear the high cost of the
            subsequent financial restructuring. The main lessons learned
            from this project are: It is unrealistic to expect quick
            results in improving the commercial performance of most
            developing country power utilities. Government-power utility
            performance contracts are ineffective in improving utility
            performance. Performance-linked management contracts have a
            better chance of producing the desired results than
            traditional, risk-free technical arrangements. Independent
            regulators for tariff setting are highly desirable because
            they depoliticize difficult decisions, while rendering them
            transparent and objective. ",Country :  Ghana,Content Type : Reports,"June 29, 1999

What works in public utility reform:  Lessons from evaluations in the energy and water sectors, Web Resource,"Utility reform has never been more important. The COVID-19 pandemic has badly impacted utilities across the world. Many utilities are now under intensified financial stress due to budget reductions and a loss of revenue, resulting from a sudden drop in collection rates, suspension of billing, and tariff adjustment in some countries. This, in turn, has made it more challenging to ensure continued service delivery.

IEG recently published the synthesis Public Utility Reform: What lessons can we learn from IEG evaluations in the energy and water sectors?, a compilation of evidence of what worked and what did not work, and why, in World Bank support of public utility reforms in the energy and water sectors in its client countries. Its findings are even more relevant in the context of uncertainty about medium-to long-term outlook for recovery from the challenges imposed by COVID-19.

Well before COVID-19, financial viability and institutional accountability were the two main challenges faced by public utilities in improving service outcomes in the energy and water sectors. Now, the effectiveness of utilities in these two fundamental areas remain critical for ensuring the quality and sustainability of these vital basic services during a post-pandemic recovery.

Financial Viability

IEG analysis reveals a range of World Bank interventions geared to support financial viability in both the energy and water sectors.

 

Recovering the cost of service is at the core of sector reform. Across both water and energy sectors, inadequate cost recovery is a key driver of financial underperformance. Poor bill collection and operational inefficiencies (including excessive network losses) also have a significant role. IEG finds that, while tariff reform is fundamental, improving operational efficiency of service providers is crucial for financial sustainability. The cumulative evidence indicates that when inefficiencies result in high-cost service provision, improving utilities’ operational efficiency should precede or go hand-in-hand with tariff increases. Additionally, the gains from reductions in technical and commercial losses, improvements in payment collection, financial management, and demand side management proved easier to sustain once implemented. 

Evidence points to the importance of strengthening utilities’ commercial orientation, which is vital for the provision of adequate and reliable services, regardless of whether the service delivery agents are under public or private ownership. Utilities that emphasize cost control, customer orientation, and responsiveness to incentives are more likely to make meaningful progress. For example, World Bank operations in Vietnam and Turkey helped improve financial sustainability of electric power utilities through technical support and policy reforms, incrementally implementing tariff and market regulations in the electricity sector.

Utilities may need more financial support as they weather the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic. However, as the recently published IEG evaluation State your Business! An evaluation of World Bank Group support to the Reform of State-Owned Enterprises cautions, temporary subsidies introduced at the time of COVID-19 can pose “policy traps” supported by powerful vested interests, which can be hard to reverse once the crisis is over.

 

Institutional Accountability

Creating the right accountability and incentives is essential for effective service delivery. In both energy and water sectors, institutional accountability is critically tied to performance.  Sustaining reforms requires competent institutions and strong administrative capacity.  Improved performance can be a first step towards attracting private sector investment. 

Strengthening sector planning, utility management, capacity and skills, can improve sector outcomes. A solid sectoral fiscal, financial, and regulatory framework also defines and sets the context for leveraging markets and the private sector to support service delivery.

There are multiple institutional pathways that could lay the foundation for improved and sustained service delivery. There is no single model but there are certain principles that work.

In energy, improved accountability and regulatory performance drive sector outcomes. Good practices on corporate governance and regulation enable the sector environment to leverage markets and the private sector. In Rwanda, for example, the World Bank (through budget support operations), the International Finance Corporation  (through advisory services), and Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) helped the government develop sector regulatory structures and separate water and electricity utilities to improve governance, accountability and transparency. Institutional and policy reforms transformed the Rwanda Energy Group into a commercially operated state-owned enterprise and helped attract private finance.

In water, improved capacity, incentives, and transparent rules on accessing funds can ensure good sector outcomes. Good financial and operational data systems are also important. In Peru, the utility Sedapal radically changed its corporate management approach and work culture, including adopting a new performance-based compensation and incentive system driven by reaching results targets. IEG’s field-based assessment confirmed a steady improvement in access coverage, basic service parameters, and operational and financial performance.

Political and social challenges

In both sectors, utilities' operations and management are closely linked to the political economy in which they operate. Political economy considerations can inform specific design elements, including choices of programmatic instruments vs. standalone operations, or front-loading vs. back-loading of important reform actions in a programmatic series. Experience shows that support to operations needs to match the time frame in which effective government action can reasonably take place. The World Bank’s experience shows that complementary interventions and sustained support contribute positively to favorable and enduring results.

Regarding tariff reform, the institutional, political, and social challenges are considerable. Public opposition to tariff reforms reflects a lack of confidence in public service improvements and that vulnerable groups will be protected. At the same time, it is important to address potentially negative distributional consequences of reforms through such measures as differentiated tariffs and targeted assistance programs. Their success depends on the government’s ability to reach vulnerable households through fiscally sustainable programs.

Guinea - Completion and learning review for the period of FY14-FY17 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This Review of the World Bank Group’s (WBG) Completion and Learning Review (CLR) covers the original period of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Guinea (FY14-FY17) and the Performance and Learning Review (PLR) in FY16. 

Guinea is a low-income country with a GNI per capita of $670 in 2016 and with rich mining and water-based resources. Average annual GDP growth during the 2014-2016 period (4.6 percent) was marginally lower than during the previous four-year period (4.9 percent). Average growth was sustained despite a slowdown resulting from two major shocks: the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in 2014, which reduced international travel, investments, domestic commerce and services; and the decline in aluminum prices, which reduced Guinea’s bauxite ore export prices and revenues. Despite positive per capita growth, social development made little progress. Poverty rates were 53.0 percent in 2007 and 55.2 percent in 2012, the last year of available poverty estimates. Guinea’s Human Development Index remained flat at 0.4 from 2012 to 2015 and placed the country in the low human development category and ranked 183 out of 188 countries in 2015. Rural social conditions are particularly dire, with rural poverty rates much higher (64.7 percent in 2012) than urban rates (35.4 percent).

Bhutan - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2011-14 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the FY2011-FY2014 Bhutan Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of FY2011and the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) of FY2013, and assesses the CPS Completion Report (CPSCR). The CPS was jointly implemented by IDA and IFC; this review covers the joint program of the two institutions. The CPS was aligned with Bhutan's development strategies and program and covered four results clusters, (1) Private Sector Development; (2) Employment and Skills Development; (3) Sustainable Urban-Rural Development; and (4) Access to Quality Public Services. IEG rates the overall outcome of WBG support as Moderately Satisfactory. Under the first Cluster, the time it takes to start a business and obtain project approval, was reduced sharply for priority sectors along with simplification of business licensing and an electronic inventory of licenses. However, other obstacles in the investment climate remained in place; for example, new licensing, public-private partnership, and financial inclusion policies were formulated but yet to be adopted. Access to credit was increased; a financial literacy campaign was carried out; payments, settlement, and clearing systems were modernized, while bank lending flowed to real estate and consumption rather than to productive investments, ending in a credit freeze and an increase in nonperforming loans. In the financial sector, IFC provided advisory services and training and made a large equity investment, but fell short in leveraging private sector participation and improving efficiency of, and access to, financial services. Under Cluster 2, skills and training initiatives piloted with the private sector that were relevant to industry needs, marked a significant beginning to reducing urban youth unemployment. However, these are preliminary results pending a deeper study of the labor market and disincentives to youth taking up training. Under Cluster 3, urban works were delayed with variable achievement of targets; improved tax systems were introduced, but implementation of targeted revenues was yet to take place. Farm roads, irrigation, extension, sustainable land management and school expansion made a major contribution to reducing rural poverty, but improved beneficiary coverage could not be achieved as envisaged in community water supply and sanitation. Under Cluster 4, public budgeting and monitoring systems were modernized, and service standards were established for public services, but these were yet to address the issues of equity and efficiency reflected in the analytic work in education, health, and nutrition. Contributions in higher education were limited to a policy note in the absence of a project as envisaged, and national awareness of issues and policy options in nutrition was raised through analytic work; implementation of follow-up policy actions is reported as since having begun. The CPSCR highlights as lessons, (i) the importance of budget support for dialogue and reform; (ii) the need for realism in the results framework; (iii) clearer identification of capacity constraints; (iv) careful choice between lending or Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) driven by realistic results expectations; (v) policy dialogue or technical assistance to follow up after completed projects; and (vi) building on the Bank's comparative advantage in Bhutan's transition. IEG agrees and notes that (a) program results would be improved by clarity on the effects of hydropower construction in the medium-term; (b) an analysis of the financial sector's structural constraints; and (c) greater realism in addressing constraints in private sector development.

The objectives of ESW are to inform lending, inform government policy, build client capacity, stimulate public debate, and influence the development community.  The objectives of TA are to assist in policy implementation, strengthen institutions, and facilitate knowledge exchange.  ESW and TA are an essential part of the Bank's engagement with its clientsâit spent $910 million (or 26 percent of its spending on country services) on these products during FY00-06. The majority of ESW and TA met their objectives at least to an average extent during FY00-06, although there were substantial differences across countries and tasks.  ESW and TA of higher technical quality were clearly more effective in meeting their objectives.  Close collaboration with clients from task initiation through the formulation of recommendations was important for ESW and TA to be effective, whether clients were involved in the production of the task or not.  Sustained follow-up after the completion of the tasks was important for effectiveness.  Whether clients requested the tasks did not matter for effectiveness, although all tasks needed to be tailored to client needs and interests to be effective.  ESW and TA were less effective in countries where government capacity was lower.  Clients in middle-income countries prefer nonlending to lending services, and clients in all countries prefer TA over ESW. IEG has five recommendations for Bank action to obtain better results from ESW and TA.  First, reinvigorate the mandate (which underpinned the ESW reforms in FY99) to maintain a strong knowledge base on countries and sectors where the Bank is providing or planning to provide funds.  Second, ensure ESW in IDA countries are adequately-resourced (even if it means fewer ESW), since cost matters for quality, and quality matters for effectiveness.  Third, enhance institutional arrangements for ESW and TA by ensuring substantive task team presence in country officesâparticularly in countries with low institutional capacityâto facilitate closer client collaboration.  Fourth, recognize, receive, and build on client feedback to counter-balance current Bank incentives for lending over nonlending and ESW over TA.  Fifth, take the results tracking framework for ESW and TA more seriously, including systematizing client feedback.", ,Content Type : Reports,"September 23, 2008

"Seven Findings for the Nexus of Infrastructure, Agriculture, and the Environment", PDF file,"Development thinking has come in waves, with emphasis shifting from infrastructure to agriculture, to the macroeconomy and to human development. Interest in infrastructure and agriculture now has been renewed at the World Bank, following a decline in their lending during the 1990s. While this decline is now being reversed, the application of the lessons of experience, such as neglect of environmental sustainability, will contribute to better results. Experience shows that countrywide reforms can accelerate development, as a rising tide lifts all boats. Furthermore, progress in one area positively influences others: for example, improved health contributes to better learning outcomes and vice versa. There are also common lessons across sectors on the role of government. This brief clarifies the degree to which lending has varied. It then focuses on seven findings crucial to the Bank's interest in supporting infrastructure and agriculture, together with concern for the environment. These findings draw primarily on recent OED evaluations, but resonate with findings from other sources. Many of these findings have influenced Bank policy and operations.", ,Content Type : Reports,"December 1, 2006

For each of the main objectives, the CAE will evaluate the relevance of the objective, the relevance of the Bank's strategy towards meeting the objective, including the balance between adjustment and non-adjustment lending and between lending and non-lending instruments, the efficacy with which the strategy was implemented and the results achieved.  The ultimate goal is to assess whether the Bank's program achieved a particular Bank objective or planned outcome and had a substantive impact on the country's development.

International Finance Corporation Additionality in Middle-Income Countries (Approach Paper), PDF file,"Accounting for almost half of global gross domestic product and 70 percent of the world’s population, middle-income countries (MICs) face multiple development challenges limiting achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including poverty and inclusion, climate change, financial access, and economic diversification and market development. The International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) portfolio is focused heavily on MICs. Additionality is the unique support that IFC brings to a private client or client country that is not typically offered by commercial sources of finance (IFC 2019). This evaluation assesses the unique support and value addition (additionality) that the International Finance Corporation (IFC) provides to middle-income countries (MICs). It will cover IFC’s support of MICs through investment and advisory projects, and through its platforms and partnerships. The primary audience is the World Bank Group Board and IFC management and staff, however some findings of the evaluation will be relevant to a broader audience including multilateral and bilateral financing private sector activities, investors, and government officials and practitioners in client countries.

Mozambique - Enterprise Development Project, Web Resource,"The project's development objective was to broaden the base of private participation in Mozambican economic growth, through (i) increasing the competitiveness of Mozambican private firms; (ii) enhancing access to term finance; and (iii) building the capacity of selected government and non-government agencies.
	
	Project outcome is rated as moderately satisfactory. The assessment draws four lessons, (i) in post conflict countries with weak institutions and capacity constraints, achieving major economic reforms requires continuous effort and liaison with many ministries and agencies, over a substantial period of time. Rather than a single project with multiple components, a programmatic approach could also have provided opportunities to learn from each phase as inputs to designing the next. The value of a phased approach was demonstrated by the follow on private sector development project, which incorporated lessons from the present project; (ii) matching grant programs can potentially be an effective way of providing incentives to firms. Such programs have to be well managed to be successful; outsourcing to a well-established institution with the right expertise helps, i.e., business services require a combination of international expertise, local knowledge, autonomy in administration, and adaptability to respond to market demand; (iii) too much dispersion in capacity building components could limit deeper institutional reforms. It is important to avoid focusing simultaneously on too many different issues, and the impact would have been greater if institutional reforms and capacity building were to have been addressed in separate projects; and (iv) credit line operations that are designed solely to increase the supply of funds do not increase sustainable access to finance if other institutional, legal and regulatory constraints to financial sector development are not addressed. Lines of Credit require careful preparation, including assessments of (a) overall demand; (b) factors that could dampen demand, such as high interest rates; and, (c) on the supply side, factors that may limit commercial banks' appetite to lend to small and medium enterprises, even if they have the resources (e.g., limited information on borrowers' creditworthiness, poor laws on collateral, or the availability of other opportunities for investing with potentially lower risk adjusted returns).

Nigeria - Second Primary Education Project; and Universal Basic Education Project, Web Resource ,"This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Nigeria Second Primary Education Project and the Nigeria Universal Basic Education Project. The first operation was financed through IDA in the amount of US$55 million (SDR40.1 million) and with planned government contribution of US$3.5 million. The second operation was financed through an IDA Credit in the amount of US$101 million (SDR76.3 million), a grant of US$l5.0 million from the United Kingdom Department for International Development, and with planned contributions of government (US$13 million). These two projects were chosen for a PPAR because of their importance to Nigeria's development strategy and to Africa's achievement of Education for All (EFA).
The main lessons from the experience of PEP2 and UBEP are as follows: 1) good performance during implementation cannot make up for fundamental design flaws in a project in which component activities are not well aligned with the project development objectives (PDOs). UBEP suffered from too much complexity and spread limited resources too thinly among the 16 states and numerous federal agencies. The states did not have the capacity to implement such a complex design and spreading the resources too thinly did not allow for reaching the critical mass needed to have a catalytic impact upon the system; 2) lack of readiness for implementation cannot be compensated for by imposing many conditions of effectiveness. In hindsight the UBEP was not really ready to start implementation at the time of Board approval and the introduction of conditions of effectiveness could not make up for this lack of readiness; 3) technical assistance (TA) needs to be closely aligned with the project development objectives and institutional capacity gaps, and closely supervised by the Bank and co-financiers to prevent it from drifting away from PDOs. Although the TA was implemented by the Department for International Development (DFID) contractors, the Bank did not exercise close monitoring and evaluation initially. The broadly stated TOR led the TA providers to focus initially on school development and not on the strategic management competencies needed to manage a Bank supported project; and 4) effective monitoring and evaluation of learning outcomes require a long lead time to design and develop and thus need to be addressed early in project design along with PDOs. A major shortcoming in the UBEP design was its failure to build upon the measures of learning assessment built into PEP2. Learning assessments, or other measures for monitoring quality of outcomes, can be used to feed back into the improvement of curriculum, teaching and school management.",Country :  Nigeria,Content Type : Reports,"June 26, 2008

            and examines the implementation of the FY03-FY05 CAS. The
            implementation of the FY03-FY05 CAS was extended de facto
            through FY07 and therefore this review covers the period
            FY03-FY07. The FY03-FY05 CAS supported the Poverty Reduction
            Strategy adopted by the newly democratically elected
            Government of Niger in December 2001. The PRSP (2001) was to
            serve as the reference framework for its economic, financial
            and social policy. The CAS had centered the program around
            the four central pillars of the PRSP which were to: (I)
            ensure economic and financial stability while promoting
            sustainable and robust growth; (ii) develop productive

            outside the government, at the central and local level. In
            summary, the CAS was relevant in its objectives as they were
            consistent with the Government's poverty reduction
            strategy but its design was weakly relevant. It could have
            been strengthened through a better conceptualization of its
            growth strategy, the development of an explicit framework to
            build capacity and structuring a rigorous results framework,

            evaluation reviewed the Bank's country assistance
            during the period 1993-2003. The FY2000 country assistance
            strategy (CAS) was well aligned with the government's
            development goals, but its implementation differed
            considerably from plan: the envisaged large program of
            analytical and advisory activities (AAA) and program lending
            did not materialize. There was a misunderstanding from the
            outset about what assistance the government wanted from the
            Bank. The Bank pursued four objectives during this period:
            improving macroeconomic stability and public expenditure
            management, supporting education development, improving
            forestry management, and improving infrastructure. This
            review agrees with the CAS completion report (CR) that,
            overall, the outcome of the Bank assistance program since
            FY2000 has been moderately satisfactory. Bank assistance
            addressed all important development issues, and the
            implementation of Bank assistance followed more closely
            government preferences and complemented the assistance of
            other donors. The CASCR provides a detailed account and
            balanced assessment of Bank assistance during FY2000-05.
            This operations evaluation department (OED) assessment
            offers three findings: in a small country the Bank needs to
            be selective in its interventions; it needs to focus on

Bulgaria - Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan Project, Web Resource,"This audit rates the overall outcome
            as satisfactory, which concurs with the rating of the ICR.
            The government of Bulgaria has made satisfactory progress in
            all five policy areas, and excellent progress in some. The
            strongest areas have been international trade and
            privatization, while the weakest areas have been cereals
            marketing and rural finance. this audit rates institutional
            development impact as substantial, and sustainability of the
            policy reforms as likely, which also concurs with the ICR.
            While the government has sometimes taken longer than
            expected to pass legislation, the government's progress
            has been more or less uniformly forward, with little
            backtracking. In order to realize the full pay-off from the
            reforms, Bulgaria needs to sustain policy reforms in farm
            consolidation, the transfer of irrigation assets to water
            users' associations, post-privatization restructuring
            and consolidation in the agro-processing sector, and the
            recapitalization of the agricultural sector. Some OED
            lessons concern the need for developing the political
            consensus for reform in the form of sector adjustment loans

Philippines - Completion and Learning Review : IEG Review, Web Resource ,"The Philippine economy has been growing rapidly over the past decade. However, performance on poverty reduction, inequality and human development has been persistently low. The country is also a natural disaster hotspot, with frequent typhoons, tropical storms and earthquakes. It has also been affected by internal unrest, predominantly the protracted conflict and violence on the southern island of Mindanao. The 2014 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was well aligned with the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2011-16 that aimed at reducing poverty and improving the lives of the poorest segments of the population. The subsequent PDP 2017-22 shifted some emphasis to major infrastructure investments – where the WBG has not been particularly active – but also seeks to lift about six million citizens from poverty, achieve upper-middle income status by 2022, and to deliver a comprehensive agenda for peace and development in conflict-affected areas. The WBG program as adjusted in the 2017 PLR was therefore well aligned with significant aspects of the current PDP. The CPS set out a program that was divided in five focus areas: Transparent and Accountable Government; Empowerment of the Poor and the Vulnerable; Rapid, Inclusive and Sustained Economic Growth; Climate Change, Environment, and Disaster Risk Management; and Peace, Institution-Building, and Social and Economic Opportunity – all these areas were of high priority for the country and under the PDP.

            After a period of conflict and instability, Liberia’s Gross
            Domestic Product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 6.2
            percent during 2003-2013. The ebola virus disease (EVD)
            crisis of 2014-2016 and a drop in global commodity prices
            resulted in slower average annual GDP growth of 2.1 percent
            with per capita annual GDP growth at -0.4 percent during
            2013-2017. As a post conflict country aiming to achieve
            sustained broad-based growth, Liberia faces several
            development challenges: large infrastructure gaps, poor
            education and health indicators, a large youth cohort, lack
            of economic diversification, and weak public institutions.
            The World Bank Group’s country partnership strategy had
            three pillars: (i) economic transformation; (ii) human
            development; and (iii) governance and public sector
            institutions. In addition, the CPS had two cross-cutting
            themes of capacity development and gender equality. The CPS
            focus areas and objectives were well aligned with the
            government’s agenda for transformation with a strong focus
            on infrastructure. The CLR provided a succinct assessment of
            the achievement of program objectives. It identified the
            increases in IDA lending attributable to the EVD outbreak.
            The CLR review agrees with the CLR lessons: (i) ensure
            government’s strong commitment to the CPF program through
            close alignment with the country’s development plans; (ii)
            adapt and apply a sound post-conflict and fragile country
            lens in the design of CPF programs for post conflict
            countries; (iii) keep an eye on medium-term goals even in
            the face of a crisis such as EVD; (iv) being selective about
            cross-cutting themes and including outcomes associated with
            these themes helps maintain the Government’s and Country
            Team’s focus on them throughout implementation. IEG provides
            the following additional lessons: (i) flexibility of the CPS
            program enabled the WBG to respond to the EVD crisis in a
            timely manner; and (ii) trust fund activities need to have a
            well-articulated strategic focus and explicit selectivity

            (i) growth and employment; (ii) service provision for human
            development; and (iii) governance for empowerment. Lending
            was higher than planned, with a focus on support to the

            of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), which made up
            42 percent of actual lending. The lending envelope was
            raised because of a strong policy performance responding,
            inter alia, to the incentives for HlPC completion, and some
            improvements in portfolio performance. IEG agrees with the
            lessons drawn by the CASCR, and supports proposed steps to
            improve the results framework and the effectiveness of
            sector budget support operations, and heightening use of
            stronger cross-sectoral approaches. IEG supports the lesson

Côte d’Ivoire : Agriculture Sector Support Project, Web Resource,"The Agriculture Sector Support
            Project (PSAC) in Côte d’Ivoire was conceived in 2010–12 to
            support government reforms to achieve a more competitive,
            sustainable, and private sector–led cash crop sector and to
            ensure sustained increases in producers’ incomes. The PSAC
            focused on Côte d’Ivoire’s five key export commodities:
            cocoa, rubber, oil palm, cotton, and cashew nuts. It
            supported value chain development for these commodities
            through three strategic pathways: (i) improving production
            technologies and smallholder farmer access to them, (ii)
            improving smallholder farmer access to markets, and (iii)
            enhancing value chain governance. An integrated package of
            productivity, marketing, and institutional interventions was
            implemented for each commodity as a pilot in its most
            important or representative production region. Ratings for
            this project are as follows: Outcome was moderately
            satisfactory, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,
            and Quality of monitoring and evaluation was modest. This
            assessment offers the following lessons: (i) Project
            relevance and efficacy are enhanced by aligning projects
            with national strategies, building on existing institutional
            mechanisms and stakeholder consensus and supporting ongoing
            activities. (ii) Project efficiency and sustainability are
            enhanced by ensuring continuity in coordination and
            management staffing from design to implementation to
            postproject internalization. (iii) Projects with short time
            frames need to set realistic goals on institutional
            development and governance improvement, while adapting to
            institutional and political risks, to be effective. (iv)
            Effective institutional development requires elaborate
            methodologies and monitoring frameworks, instead of merely
            end goals and flexible ad hoc approaches. (v) Reinforcing
            the role of IPOs and producer cooperatives in agricultural
            value chains requires buy-in from both the state and the
            private sector on a well-defined and well-balanced
            demarcation of roles and powers, and a solid and loyal base
            of professionalized cooperatives ensuring true
            representativity. (vi) A diverse set of productivity
            enhancement interventions can support overcoming challenges
            of rural poverty, lack of competitiveness, demographic
            pressure, and land scarcity. (vii) Sustainability of project
            achievements can be compromised if contingencies among
            development pathways are not recognized or if they are not
            capitalized on by the government. (viii) Co-financing
            provides critical leverage and ownership; however, sustained
            effects require co-management and arrangements for
            postproject continuation. ",Country :  Cote d'Ivoire,Content Type : Reports,"February 3, 2023

Cameroon - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2004-08 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The CASCR reviews the effectiveness
            of Bank strategy in Cameroon over the period FY04-08,
            including both the FY04-06 CAS and a FY07-08 Interim
            Strategy Note (ISN). These were both joint strategies
            between IDA and IFC. This review of the CASCR covers the
            IDA-related aspects and is evaluated by the IEG-WB. The
            IFC-related aspect of the CAS and ISN are not being reviewed
            by IEG-IFC. Throughout the period the objectives of the Bank
            strategy were twofold: improved pro-poor economic management
            and service delivery, and improved conditions for private
            sector growth. The Bank's strategy was relevant in the
            sense that it focused on priorities identified in the PRSP.
            But this relevance was seriously compromised by a lack of
            realism given weak government commitment to reform, limited
            implementation capacity, and a lack of concreteness in the
            outcomes being pursued. Together, the Bank's over
            optimism and the government's slow pace of reform
            implementation led to frequent delays. There were two key
            lessons for the Bank which follows from the poor results
            achieved. First, in many ways the program suffered from weak
            government demand for reform which caused delays and/or
            inaction. Support for the privatization agenda was
            unenthusiastic, there was little interest in environmental
            issues and better forest management, and there was even less
            interest in improving transparency. Second, while
            substantial resources were spent on supervision, it still
            proved to be inadequate. Examples include the privatization
            agenda and education sector reform where intensified
            supervision could have avoided inaction and/or a quicker
            response to the need for project restructuring. ",Country :  Cameroon,Content Type : Reports,"March 22, 2010

            the environment and services for non-oil growth; and (III)
            enhance transparency and accountability for better

            approach outlined in earlier Bank strategy documents and
            were adopted as the pillars for the CPS in 2005. The CPS was
            designed as a joint Bank-Department for International
            Development (DFID) approach to assist Nigeria in
            implementing its program to boost growth and achieve the

            accountability for better governance. The CPS differentiated
            Bank efforts at the federal and state levels. At the federal
            level the Bank used traditional investment loans to support
            the three pillars. At the state level, the Bank sought to
            create a model that could be scaled up, by working in six

Pakistan - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2002-05 : IEG review, Web Resource,"This country assistance strategy
            completion report (CASCR) review covers the period June 2002
            through June 2005. The main objectives of the CAS were: (i)
            strengthening the basis for macroeconomic stability and
            government effectiveness; (ii) strengthening the enabling
            investment climate; and (iii) supporting pro-poor and
            pro-gender-equity policies. These objectives are both
            relevant and broadly consistent with the government's
            priorities. While good progress was made in macroeconomic
            stability and improving the investment climate, there was
            only minimal or partial achievement of objectives in
            governance, rural development, education, health, and
            pro-poor policies. Independent evaluation group (IEG) rates
            the overall outcome rating as moderately satisfactory. Three
            of the CASCR recommendations are consistent with country
            assistance evaluation (CAE) findings and this review: (i)
            projects should not be overly complex; (ii) the CAS program
            should give greater emphasis to capacity building; and (iii)
            the program needs to continue to strengthen its focus on
            results, and to do a better job on developing and monitoring
            indicators. The fourth recommendation of using: annual
            single tranche adjustment operations at both the provincial
            and national levels will be consistent with the CAE if the
            loans are focused and take into account capacity
            limitations. The recent CAE found that some adjustment loans
            were too broad (requiring cooperation from multiple
            counterparts), and sometimes included unrealistic, vague, or
            unsustainable conditions. This review also suggests two
            other recommendations, which were also recommended under the

            Nets Project (APL1) for Ethiopia were as follows: outcomes
            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was
            significant, Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower
            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons
            learned included: donor coordination can be critical for
            improving fiscal and institutional capacity of governments
            and efficiency and effectiveness of social safety nets.
            Commitments of technical and financial support from donors
            are most effective when donors align around a common
            framework and principles for engaging with government. The
            role of social safety nets in a particular country context
            evolves over time as SSN institutions are created and the
            capacity to identify different subgroups of poor and
            vulnerable households expands. Whereas initially the project
            was designed to address regular shocks in rural areas
            leading to annual emergency food appeals, the dialogue has
            evolved towards programming options to address two different
            types of poor, rural households: those with longer term
            potential to graduate out of poverty and those who face
            chronic challenges. Contingency funds serve a critical role
            enabling government to scale up safety nets both in terms of
            transfer size and coverage to address transitory shocks,
            even in low income countries. Both cash and food transfers
            can be appropriate depending on specific circumstances, such
            as the level of seasonal variability in food prices, and it
            is important to be pragmatic about what mix of transfer
            types is best. Whatever transfer type, predictability is
            critical. Achieving timely transfers in low income settings
            is possible but requires investments in capacity building
            and continuous monitoring. ",Country :  Ethiopia,Content Type : Reports,"June 16, 2011

Creating Markets for Sustainable Growth and Development: An Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Client Countries FY 07-17 (Approach Paper), PDF file,"The international development community is increasingly turning to the private sector in its pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Involving the private sector as a financier, operator or service provider in SDG relevant areas requires creating markets, i.e., putting in place an enabling business environment, overcoming a range of markets constraints, and/or enhancing competition through regulatory reform, pioneering investments or innovation. All these creating markets components imply certain roles for the private sector, the government and regulatory authorities. Since the 2002 World Bank Group (WBG) Private Sector Development Strategy creating markets has been a well-established part of the WBG-wide development agenda. The objective of this evaluation is to distill lessons from the Bank Group’s experience in creating markets to leverage the private sector for sustainable development and growth. Such lessons are intended to inform future program development and the upcoming implementation of the Creating market / Cascade approach. In this regard, the evaluation will obtain evidence-based findings, develop broadly-applicable lessons across the Bank Group, and propose appropriate recommendations.", ,Content Type : Reports,"February 20, 2018

            was to help create the conditions for a sustained reduction
            of poverty levels in Guyana. The objective was supported by
            three reform pillars that corresponded to the key priorities
            outlined in the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
            (PRSP): (1) stimulate economic growth through sound
            macroeconomic management, efficient implementation of the
            public investment program (especially in the sugar sector),
            and improved environment for private business; (2) improve
            public governance and accountability by strengthening
            oversight systems and building capacity; and (3) enhance the
            provision of, and access to, basic services and safety nets.
            The Bank’s assistance strategy was supported by programmatic
            loans and three investment projects amounting to US$47.7
            million and five grantsltrust funds amounting to US$16.09
            million. It also provided substantial complementary
            analytical and advisory services. Although Guyana’s
            macroeconomic performance was acceptable and some progress
            was shown in advancing the reforms agenda, reduction in

            poor outcome in poverty reduction, IEG rates the overall
            outcome as moderately unsatisfactory. The Bank’s assistance
            strategy was overly ambitious although it made adjustments
            during the implementation period. Its contribution to the

            satisfactory. Under Pillar II The objectives of improving
            public governance and accountability and strengthening
            oversight systems were modestly achieved with some progress
            in public procurement and finance management where laws were
            passed, but institutional follow through was weak. Little
            progress was made in local government reform and the PRSP
            monitoring and evaluation was established for a few years,
            but disbanded in 2007. The modest progress made was despite
            the government’s tepid support for these reforms. IEG rates

            unsatisfactory. Under Pillar Ill: The objectives of
            enhancing basic services and safety nets were partially

FSPâs development objective was to contribute to the Government's efforts to ensure an aggregate availability of supply of chemical fertilizers for the 2009-2010 production season, adequate to meet smallholder farmers' priority demands. The program goal was to increase the likelihood that crop production in 2009-2010 would remain on or near the growth trends of recent years.
IEG has rated the overall project outcome as moderately unsatisfactory. The risk to development outcome is rated moderate even though this was an operation with a limited, time-bound objective. The assessment rates both Bank and Borrower performance as moderately unsatisfactory because of issues related to inadequate attention to competition with food aid, weak duediligence on demand-estimation, shortcomings on financial management, safeguards and delayed attention to monitoring and evaluation during implementation.

IEG found that certain parts of the Bank-supported higher education reform model flourished in the three countries. Competitively awarded grants motivated departments and staff members to come up with innovative programs, many connected to the labor market or addressing a national development issue. The efforts to reform (or pilot new forms of) university governance were stillborn in all three countries.

It provides a multidimensional perspective on developmentâcombining income growth, equity, and environmental quality. This report's concerns are at the core of the development policy debate. The underlying analysis combines a variety of data and methodological approachesâfrom standard crosscountry growth regressions to project data and country experiences. This report is intended to stimulate discussion in this critical area, particularly where the challenges from environmental and climate change problems, rising income inequality, energy subsidies in the face of rapidly rising energy prices, and widely uneven progress in combating poverty are becoming more serious.", ,Content Type : Reports,"January 25, 2010

Making Roads Safer: Learning from the World Bank's Experience, PDF file,"	Every year, nearly 1.3 million people worldwide are killed in road crashes, which have become the leading cause of death among people between the ages of fifteen and twenty-nine. More than 90 percent of the world's road fatalities occur in developing countries, and half of the accident victims are pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. Road accidents disproportionately affect the poor, making road safety an economic development issue. Many crash victims are of working age, and their death or serious injury too frequently leaves their dependents destitute. Governments in poorer countries have assumed they cannot act to reduce death rates until they are wealthier. However, many of today's road safety measures can be implemented relatively inexpensively to reduce death rates, if managed correctly.

	In 2008, the Bank made road safety a pillar of its transport sector strategy and adopted the safe systems approach in one or two projects in each Region. More recently, the Bank fully adopted the tactic for all roads projects where feasible and encouraged road safety authorities to adopt this practice nationwide.

The four projects reviewed in this report represent an important effort by the Bank to assist the Government to address these critical infrastructure and capacity building needs directly related to the well being of people in the rural sector. The Agriculture Productivity Improvement Project, approved in 1997, was intended to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to implement a coordinated national program to help improve the quantity and quality of the technical, human and physical resources required to promote sustainable agricultural development improvements in Cambodia. The overall outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The Northeast Village Development Project, approved in 1999, was intended to introduce decentralized, participatory, and poverty-focused approaches to rural development in some of the poorest areas of Cambodia. The overall outcome is rated satisfactory. The Forest Concession Management and Control Pilot Project, also a LIL and approved in 2000, was intended to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive set of operational guidelines and control procedures for sustainable forest management in concession areas, and to establish an effective forest crime monitoring and prevention capability. The overall outcome is rated unsatisfactory. The Flood Emergency Rehabilitation Project, approved in 2001, was intended to rehabilitate the economic and social infrastructure damaged by the 2000 floods and to assist the Government in formulating a long-term strategy aimed at reducing the country's vulnerability to flooding. The overall outcome is rated satisfactory. These projects provide five lessons: (1) Use of the Learning Instrument Loan: While it is understood that Learning Instrument Loan or other simplified instruments should not require the same amount of analysis as standard investments loans, the risk review analysis carried out at the concept review stage should identify any particular fiduciary or safeguards that would require regular preparation and appraisal; (2) The Importance of Continuous Contact for Effective Implementation: The fragile institutional framework in post-conflict Cambodia and the limited counterpart pool undermined the effectiveness of periodic Bank supervision and credibility; (3) Sector and Country Strategies as a Management Tool for Operations: Sector or country strategies are often seen as the leading edge for policy dialogue and the identification of investment opportunities, but their usefulness during project implementation may not be as widely recognized; (4) A Gradual Approach to Change: Institutions generally respond more favorably to moderate or gradual change than to radical innovation, particularly when power or stature is being threatened; and (5) Dealing with Informal Transaction Costs as a Development Issue: To an outsider, informal transactions costs may be seen as corruption, but to a participant they may be an expected form of sharing or a means of reaffirming one's role in a group.",Country :  Cambodia,Content Type : Reports,"June 27, 2007

Azerbaijan - Country partnership strategy completion and learning review for the period FY2011-14 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The FY10-FY13 CPS and its progress
            report closely followed a prolonged period of economic
            difficulties, internal political conflict and institutional
            deterioration. Consequently, the primary focus of the
            WBG's strategy was on economic recovery and
            reconstruction. The strategy was built around four pillars:
            strengthening governance and institutions, improving the
            performance of the agricultural sector, private sector
            development, and renewing infrastructure and basic services.
            The strategy was well aligned with the country's
            program and received strong government commitment. While the
            challenges of the WBG's strategy were many,
            ""Restoration of Peace"" was key and a sine qua non
            for progress. The success achieved in reintegrating
            ex-combatants and youth at risk in economic activities was a
            major achievement. Equally, the improvement in the business
            climate for entrepreneurs was important. At the same time,
            significant WBG efforts to improve the financial health of
            the electricity sector had little impact, and progress
            towards improving basic social services and renewing basic
            infrastructure was partial. Overall, the outcome rating for

            need for indicators to be measurable and available
            throughout the program for effective progress monitoring.
            Too many indicators may make it difficult to ensure all data
            is available. If indicators are not quantified it is
            difficult to make an objective judgment on achievement.
            Finally, it is important to make certain that the indicators

            social service access (offset by some deterioration in
            quality) and modest successes in agricultural development

            engagement and involvement in demanding improved services.
            Nevertheless, significant shortcomings remain: progress in
            the energy sector and on privatization is less than
            expected; and, poverty is responding only slowly to growth
            and inequality may have worsened. The government~^!!^s
            commitment to reform and external factors played an
            important role in the progress. The Bank~^!!^s assistance
            program also played a catalytic role in conceptualizing and
            helping implementation of the reforms. The FY2001-03 CAS
            was, therefore, coherent and relevant. However,
            implementation was only 40 percent of the lending
            operations, a hybrid comprising half of the low case
            operations and two additional operations from the base case.

            Kenyatta Hospital experience demonstrates that good public

            program in the project design. There are four lessons
            emerging from this project which are relevant to any program
            or project in which policy change is the main objective:
            Preparatory economic and sector analysis with a high degree
            of government ownership is vital to achieving agreement on a
            sound sector reform program. Unwavering government
            commitment to the core sector reform policy is absolutely
            essential for successful implementation of a sector program.
            This should be followed up by the planning and
            implementation of investments in technology, infrastructure,
            and support services (including financial services) to
            ensure that the impact of policy reform is sustained.
            Lastly, a strong, well managed, national multi-sectoral
            institution which takes on the responsibilities for leading
            the coordination of policy and institutional reform is
            essential, and need not impede the interests of

            the project and implemented it completely. 2) Education is a
            basis for successful adjustment. The most interesting and
            unique aspect of the project was the training that the
            political leadership undertook in order to understand what
            was being proposed and advocated by the International
            Development Association and International Monetary Fund. 3)
            Desperation was used as an incentive for adjustment.
            Political leadership was willing to make fundamental changes
            in its economic policies because of the depth and urgency of
            the problems it faced. 4) One reason that the implementation
            proceeded smoothly and the impact of the conditionally began
            to make an economic impact at an early date was that most of
            the important conditions were put into place by the

            generally result only from completed privatization. 2) The
            specific goals of the privatization program must be clearly
            articulated. 3) Lack of consensus on local ownership of
            assets should not delay privatization. 4) Close management
            of complex details will be necessary to complete
            transactions in a timely fashion without serious setbacks.
            5) The use of outside consultants and advisors is

Sustainability is rated unlikely (against non-evaluable in the ICR Review) because the project did not succeed in institutionalizing community development processes within the provincial and local administrations. For the Northwest Frontier SAC, the ratings are: moderately satisfactory outcome, modest institutional development impact, and satisfactory Bank and Borrower performance.

For the Sindh SAC, the ratings of modest institutional development impact and satisfactory Bank performance are confirmed. Outcome is moderately unsatisfactory (against satisfactory) because the pace of reforms slowed considerably after the 2002 elections, especially in redressing important bottlenecks in financial management, in civil service reform, and in promoting private sector development.

Nevertheless, real per capita incomes stagnated and the poverty rate remained higher than in the late 1980s.  Jordan made excellent progress in all other  MDG areas, but at high cost and with considerable inefficiency. World Bank assistance during the 1990s supported stabilization and structural reform, but strong and sustainable growth in real output proved difficult to achieve.  The Bank's increased focus on the social sectors was aligned with the MDGs, but the Bank did not forcefully address inefficiencies, despite analytical work that detailed how public expenditures could be reduced and better allocated.  The outcome of the Bank's relatively small assistance program in  the 1990s is rated moderately satisfactory. The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) assistance program contributed substantially to the development of key sectors:  industry and mining, public utilities, and social services.

This evaluation will aim to assess the effectiveness of the Bank's donor coordination efforts in improving the efficiency of aid delivery â pecifically reducing transactions costs, building government capacity, and improving the quality of policy dialogue. It will focus on two of the principles of the PDâharmonization and alignment (H&A)âwhich have been the central tenets of donor coordination even prior to the PD. The evaluation will be structured around the various Bank instruments for providing support to countries, including strategies, and lending and non-lending activities.

But, even if the Bank had benefited from perfect foresight, it could not have prevented the crisis; at the time, the Bank had virtually no leverage on government policies. The Bank had been following a client-oriented strategy during the decade preceding the crisis: it delivered to Thailand what the country wanted, which was not very much. This situation changed dramatically with the crisis. For assessing the quality of Bank assistance to Thailand, this report addresses three issues. First, was Bank assistance reasonably relevant and efficient in the pre-crisis period? The answer is a qualified yes. Second, was the Bank well prepared to respond to the crisis? The answer is no. Third, what is the appropriate response to the crisis now? How can the massive assistance needed to restore growth quickly and minimize social suffering in the meantime be harmoniously combined with reforms needed to promote inclusive growth in the long term?

            political will to advance privatization, and to the

            particularly problematic given the complex, multisectoral
            nature of the project. Project design ought to have
            addressed more clearly the specific functions of individual
            agencies and the interrelationships between them. Overall,
            the project is considered satisfactory despite a two year
            delay in implementation and sub-par performance of some of
            the components. The strong commitment of various levels of
            Government to Rural Development (RD) and the active role of
            the central Government in the conceptualization,
            identification and preparation phases of the project has
            been an essential ingredient of the project's success.
            The experience with this project in which the SAR is used
            exclusively as a reference point for supervision and
            monitoring processes, has raised the issue that a greater
            level of management flexibility is desirable in the design
            of RD projects. ",Country :  Sri Lanka,Content Type : Reports,"August 3, 1992

Ratings for the Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan project were as follows: outcome was satisfactory, risk to development outcome was negligible to low, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons include (i) The CAT DDO can help advance the DRM reform agenda and strengthen the clients’ system to respond to disaster risks. (ii) The CAT DDO can complement other World Bank instruments for supporting DRM reforms. (iii) The design and implementation of the CAT DDO in Colombia raised some issues that deserve further clarification.

The report also assesses the relevance, efficacy, and efficiency of that assistance, and recommends actions for the future. Although inflation, economic decline, and civil war impoverished Guatemalans in the 1980s, good economic performance during the 1990s improved their welfare, and the poverty rate declined from sixty seven percent in 1987, to fifty seven percent in 1998. The Bank played a supportive role in the country ' s recovery, and growth in the 1990s, through an assistance that evolved from financing infrastructure projects in the 1980s, to supporting loans for adjustment, reform, and public sector management. The outcome of the Bank ' s program in the 1990s was satisfactory, although its outcome for the 1980s was unsatisfactory. This difference lies in that in the early 1990s, the Bank supported programs that brought economic stability, and growth, better management, and governance of the public sector. The Bank ' s future assistance strategy should shift to help accelerate growth, and achieve ambitious poverty reduction efforts, focusing on preserving macroeconomic stability, while strengthening the financial system.",Country :  Guatemala,Content Type : Reports,"December 11, 2002

Albania: Country Assistance Evaluation (REACH), PDF file,"After a pyramid scheme collapsed in late 1996/97 that led to riots and looting, Albania forged a stable economy through sound economic management and stronger economic institutions. Rapid growth improved overall economic and social conditions, but unemployment is high and some social indicators, such as secondary school enrollment, remain behind those of neighboring countries. Between FY98 and FY04, IDA lent Albania US$485 million, among the highest of small IDA countries on a per capita basis, spread across many sectors. Bank assistance was effective in supporting infrastructure, economic stability and growth, and financial sector development, but was less effective in improving governance, institution building and human development. Looking forward, the country strategies should increase selectivity, with priority in infrastructure â including urbanâhealth and education, developing a more outcome-oriented approach and, where possible, focusing more on quality of service delivery and cost recovery. Also, Bank management should review the justification for Albania's continued IDA eligibility, explore its potential creditworthiness for IBRD lending, and ensure that the results of the analysis form the basis for the next assistance strategy.",Country :  Albania,Content Type : Reports,"September 30, 2005

In 1996, a new government initiated a shift to policies based on private sector led growth and integration into the world economy, with the overarching objective of reversing a dramatic decline in income per capita over the previous decades.  The Bank supported this shift by engaging into a dialogue on structural reforms articulated along two axes, a changing role of the public sector and promotion of the private sector as engine of growth, and covering four areas: broad-based growth led by foreign investment; human capital development; strengthening the public sector's ability to deliver quality services; and natural resource management.  Implementation was supported by two Structural Adjustment Credits (FY97 and FY99), accompanied by two technical assistance (TA) operations meant to mitigate the implementation capacity risks associated with the reforms: the Public Management Capacity Building Project (PAIGEP) and the Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project (PATESP), both of FY97.",Country :  Madagascar,Content Type : Reports,"June 6, 2006

However, questions remain on the extent of public sector monopoly, since fisheries sector growth is still significantly inhibited. Thus, while the outcome of Bank assistance over the period is rated satisfactory, sustainability is considered uncertain, and institutional development impacts moderate.

            However, the audit downgrades ratings concerning the
            Transition Assistance Credit (TAC) Project to unsatisfactory
            project outcome, and modest institutional development
            impacts, yet upgrades sustainability to likely, but assesses
            both Bank and Borrower performances as unsatisfactory. The
            main lessons from these credits suggest: 1) Upon the need to
            drastically reduce the scope of a quick-disbursement
            operation, given practical and political difficulties, this
            should provide the opportunity for an operation
            reassessment, in particular the credit amount, to ensure
            that a relationship remain between that amount and the
            policy adjustments being supported. 2) Providing general
            budget support under circumstances where there is virtually
            no auditing of, or accountability for government
            expenditures, is unwise, particularly in the absence of a
            strong, monitorable agreement with the borrower on the use
            of those funds. 3) Providing budget support, in light of
            major tax evasion and excessive government expenditures, can
            be potentially counter-productive, in the absence of an
            agreed, concerted direct attack on those elements. The
            presence of budget support reduces the natural pressure on
            governments to take urgent and meaningful action. 4) In a
            situation where there is no clear borrower commitment to a
            course of action, or there is a history of back-tracking or
            non-implementation of laws and regulations, the mere passage
            of legislation is not usually a good basis for tranche
            release conditionality. There also needs to be a period of
            implementation or, better still, conditionality based on
            actual results achieved. Given a long, complicated reform
            agenda, careful sequencing of operations is required. This
            was the case for PFSAC and PFSAC2, to be followed by the
            proposed Economic Management SAC; and for SOSAC, to be
            followed by the proposed SOSAC2, examples of good practice.
            In contrast, there was no immediate follow-up to TAC,
            compounding its poor design as a one-tranche operation. ",Country :  Bosnia and Herzegovina,Content Type : Reports,"January 27, 2005

Republic of Yemen - Vocational Training Project, Web Resource ,"Project ratings are as follows:
            Project outcome is moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability
            is likely; institutional development impact is modest; Bank
            performance is unsatisfactory; and Borrower performance is
            unsatisfactory. Experience with the assessed project
            confirms a number of OED lessons from the
            vocational-technical education sub-sector: 1) The
            establishment of functional training facilities is necessary
            but insufficient for producing skilled workers. Publicly
            financed vocational training centers are only viable when
            the government and the private sector establish a joint and
            effective strategic framework that sets priorities and
            allocates resources to those priorities.2) Many vocational
            training facilities were built when the Bank's strategy
            was oriented toward that sub-sector. Because o f the expense
            involved in technological renewal, it may be cheaper to
            abandon or rebuild some facilities than to rehabilitate
            them. However, it may be wise for the Bank to reinvest
            periodically in the renewal o f older facilities in order to
            extend the life o f earlier investments. 3) Governments may
            view vocational training as a means o f helping school
            dropouts get jobs and alleviate their poverty. However,
            vocational training centers may select the better-educated
            students who are ultimately less likely to perform the type
            o f tasks for which they were trained. Admission criteria
            might be adapted to suit the needs o f less educated
            persons, who may have limited training opportunities. 4) A
            series o f shorter vocational courses taught in the evenings
            or weekends may be more suitable to the work schedules o f
            the poor. 5) For vocational education projects to succeed,
            potential trainees and the private sector must be consulted
            on project components, outcomes, and targets. A dialogue
            held exclusively with governments risks creating projects
            for which there is relatively limited demand and commitment.
            6) The complexities of projects must match implementation
            capacity. 7) Management information systems and tracer
            studies are important tools to monitor the needs of
            beneficiaries. These activities must be given priority in

            in close cooperation with the government and was in line
            with Croatia's development strategy expressed in the
            government's ""2003-2007 Mandate"".
            Consultations with civil society and the private sector were
            also included, and close coordination was established with
            the European commission delegation to help the country meet
            EU accession requirements and absorb EU assistance. In view
            of the above context, the CAS was highly relevant: it was
            centered on four pillars or sub-objectives, designed to turn
            Croatia into a dynamic and competitive economy. The four
            pillars were: macroeconomic sustainability, sustainable
            private sector-led growth, broad participation in growth,
            and sustainable natural resource management. The pillars
            addressed both the major issues facing the Croatian economy
            at the time as well as major structural obstacles to be
            removed in order to make EU accession successful. Though not
            strictly a results-based CAS, it included a results matrix
            with key outcomes and intermediate indicators/milestones.
            The links between milestones and CAS outcomes, however, was
            often unclear and weak. Furthermore, while the CAS included
            37 outcomes only four of these were quantified. The
            centerpiece of the proposed lending program was a series of
            three programmatic adjustment loans (PALs) with
            complementary investment lending to support specific
            sectoral objectives. There were three lending scenarios
            (low, base, high case) with well-specified triggers for
            moving from one case to the next. The CAS was somewhat
            overoptimistic and the first PAL was delayed as progress in
            the steps towards entering EU accession negotiations was
            slower than expected. On the other hand, the start of these
            negotiations in October 2005 led to some adjustments in the
            Bank's strategy detailed in the 2007 CAS Progress
            Report (CASPR). ",Country :  Croatia,Content Type : Reports,"September 16, 2008

Uzbekistan - Country assistance strategy FY02-FY07 : IEG-IFC review, Web Resource,"This document will provide
            information on International Finance Corporation
            (IFC's) role, key activities and operational results
            during the period FY02-FY07. The 2008 Country Assistance
            Strategy (CAS) would have benefited from an updated CAS
            Completion Report (CASCR) with an in-depth coverage of how
            IFC's role and activities can help a transition economy
            attain greater progress in the private sector through
            project designed to provide a combination of investment and
            advisory services. IFC was to continue its dialogue with the
            Uzbekistan government and support the Bank's program to
            improve the business environment for private investment
            while, at the same time, implement a strategy where IFC
            would primarily focus on: (a) supporting micro and small and
            medium enterprise (SMEs) through lines of credit to
            commercial banks and advisory services; (b) capacity
            building for banking and non-banking financial
            intermediaries; (c) providing technical and financial
            support to selected investments in sectors with significant
            export potential such as natural resources and
            agri-processing, or where privatization was possible (banks,
            telecommunications, power, and large SOEs across a range of
            sectors); (d) providing advisory services leading to new
            private sector investment, mostly through the Private
            Enterprise Partnership (PEP) initiative where micro-leasing
            would be a key focus; and (e) seeking more investment
            opportunities in the health sector and the private sector
            insurance industry. The advisory services as identified in
            the CAS aimed at capacity building and improving the
            business enabling environment continue to remain relevant in
            Uzbekistan. As indicated in the FY02 CAS, the pace of
            privatization would have implications on the scope of its
            advisory services and potential investments in Uzbekistan.
            However the World Bank (WB) Group was overly optimistic
            regarding the pace of reforms in the country. There were
            tell-tale signs in the protracted dialogue between the
            government and the Bank that, at the outset, already
            signaled the government's lack of commitment to achieve
            the CAS objectives, and a lack of consensus to undertake the
            reforms at a faster pace. ",Country :  Uzbekistan,Content Type : Reports,"May 30, 2008

South Africa : CPS Completion Report - Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) Review, Web Resource,"The CAS Completion Report (CASCR) for
            South Africa reveals that the outcome of Bank support to
            South Africa over the period FY 2000-2006 is rated
            Moderately Unsatisfactory. Country-level macroeconomic
            management and performance outcomes were good, and
            structural policies, as reflected in policy and
            institutional indicators, improved slightly. Little progress
            was made in reducing unemployment, inequality, and income
            and non-income poverty, which were the overarching
            objectives of the Bank's strategy. The CAS outcome
            targeted by the Bank, establishment of a knowledge
            partnership supporting South Africa's development
            program, was not achieved. In line with the 1999 CAS, the
            Bank delivered TA, ESW and modest lending and supervision in
            support of a Government strategy aimed at fostering
            employment-generating growth, improved service delivery and
            asset distribution, and regional integration. Bank products
            were generally of satisfactory internal quality but, with
            some exceptions (macro-economic management, environmental
            management, regional institutions), had little or no direct
            effect on policies and/or institutional capacity and, also
            with some exceptions, generally contributed little to
            outcomes with respect to employment-generating growth with
            macroeconomic stability, social and environmental
            sustainability, or strengthening SA'S constructive role
            in regional integration. This was due to the fact that: (a)
            the Government was less prepared to work closely with the
            Bank within the traditional Bank-driven framework; and (b)
            the Bank was less prepared to deliver on an ""on-demand
            knowledge only"" agenda than suggested in the 1999 CAS.
            The Bank was slow to recognize and address these problems.
            IEG rates Bank performance over the period FY00-06 as a
            whole Moderately Unsatisfactory, with the rating driven
            mainly by its performance prior to recognizing and
            addressing the impasse (FY 2000-2003). Thereafter, Bank
            performance showed a distinct improvement, when steps were
            taken, jointly with the Government, to address problems in
            the relationship and improve the potential effectiveness and

Guinea - Second Water Supply Project, Web Resource,"The outcome of the project was

            and financial risks of a poor country, private sector

            if implemented before the operational private contracting
            assumes operations, and maintenance. Lessons suggest that:
            a) private sector participation should be considered a
            long-term public-private collaboration, to accept higher
            tariffs for better service, and to apply sector policies; b)
            special risks should be spelled out in the procedures, and

            numerous difficulties it has faced during its implementation
            including the delayed start. Staff problems were the most
            significant constraint. The difficulties were in terms of
            availability, recruitment and staffing structure.
            Availability was a problem for most grades from Agricultural
            Officer (AO) upwards. For the Field Assistant (FA), salary
            was too low. Other recruitment involved establishing posts
            for categories of staff not previously specified, such as
            the Subject Matter Specialist (SMS) and the Senior Subject
            Matter Specialist (SSMS). Many of these problems were
            probably inevitable. However, the difficulties could have
            been reduced by: greater awareness and forewarning of likely
            difficulties by government staff involved in project design
            during preparation and appraisal; or better still,
            preparation of staff structure proposals by government staff
            based on discussions with all the departments with an
            interest in the structure proposed. ",Country :  Burkina Faso,Content Type : Reports,"May 24, 1988

This review focuses on the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development's assistance program.
The CPS objectives were organized under four pillars: (i) social and spatial inclusion; (ii) public sector reform; (iii) growth and competitiveness; and (iv) regional and public goods. 
IEG rates overall outcome of the CPS as moderately satisfactory, concurring with the CPSCR. Bank support contributed to good progress toward some CPS objectives, but rarely fully achieved any.  The CPSCR provides a number of lessons and recommendations related to the delivery of knowledge services and on the approaches the Bank can take to best deliver such services. IEG endorses these lessons and recommendations, but notes that the experience of the CPS in Poland highlights the need to put in place mechanisms for systematic planning, management and evaluation of Analytical and Advisory Services and Technical Assistance programs.",Country :  Poland,Content Type : Reports,"July 1, 2013

            Project, and Beilungang Thermal Power Extension Project. The
            audit rates the outcomes of all three projects as
            satisfactory and their sustainability as likely. Key lessons
            derived from the projects are: 1) It is important to
            establish rigorous coal quality control systems in all
            existing and future coal-fired plants. 2) The higher quality
            of environmental monitoring at Beilungang can be largely
            attributed to the Bank agreeing to finance the installation
            by Zhejiang Provincial Electric Power Company of its own
            ground monitoring stations. 3) The projects demonstrates the
            benefits of the Bank and the government jointly picking a
            leader and staying with it over the long haul. 3) The slow
            progress achieved in removing distortions in tariff
            structure points to the limits of the incremental and
            pragmatic approach followed by the Chinese government on
            tariff reform. 4) Continued uncertainty about the ownership
            structure of former centrally owned assets leaves a cloud
            over the reliability of many utilities' financial
            statements. Resolution of this issue should be made a
            prerequisite for future lending. ",Country :  China,Content Type : Reports,"June 29, 1999

Pakistan - Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan, Web Resource,"The Agricultural Sector Adjustment

            achieved most of its objectives, sustainability is likely,
            and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was
            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this

            Memorandum and President's Report an explicit
            justification of loan/credit size. Second, since the quest
            for stronger project executors would slow down and
            complicate processing, it makes sense to build into
            preparation resources to ensure project leadership that is
            competent and committed to the expected design and
            implementation tasks. Also, ensuring leadership by the
            competent economic organizations in the government will
            increase government ownership of the operation. Third, in
            general, private sector procurement should be encouraged by
            permitting non-ICB procurement. Fourth, in general, greater
            reticence by Bank staff in developing policy letters will
            lead to increased ownership and more sustainable programs

            strengthening and establishing institutions to sustain a
            modern, equitable market economy, in preparation for middle
            income status. The strategy was organized around four

            environment, objectives included improving the business
            climate and strengthening competitiveness; fostering a more
            efficient, stable and responsive financial system; and
            promoting a more efficient and reliable infrastructure.
            Under pillar two, strengthening social inclusion, strategy
            objectives included improving access to markets and basic
            social services for the rural poor; providing better
            coverage of affordable quality health care services and
            primary education for the poor; fully integrating ethnic
            minorities in rural areas into the development processes;
            improving policies and infrastructure to address the needs
            of the urban poor and migrants; reducing the vulnerability
            to natural disasters and other shocks; and modernizing the
            social security system. The objectives of the strategy under
            pillar three, a more sustainable management of natural
            resources and reduced environmental degradation, were
            promoting a sustainable management of natural resources;
            improving management effectiveness of household and
            industrial pollution; and fostering climate change
            mitigation and adaptation. Objectives under pillar four,
            strengthening governance systems included improving the
            effectiveness of public financial management; modernizing
            planning with more participatory approaches; and reducing

Uruguay Country Assistance Evaluation, PDF file,"This Country Assistance Evaluation concludes that the 1997 country assistance strategy (CAS) for Uruguay was based on a good diagnosis of economic, social, and political issues in the country. The strategy adequately recognized the role of other lending institutions and effectively reflected evaluation lessons. The strategy was elaborated after a period of relatively difficult dialogue that led to negative net disbursements during 1993-97, but the region has implemented a highly effective assistance strategy since then. Consequently, the results from the Bank ' s recent experience show highly satisfactory development outcome. The agenda for development, however, is still large and the economy is highly vulnerable to changes in terms of trade, capital flows, and the economic performance of Brazil and Argentina, while banking institutions are weak and poorly regulated. This vulnerability and the incomplete development agenda have led the government to be appropriately concerned with seeing a repeat of negative net disbursements in the near future. The study recommends: 1) The Bank should continue to have flexibility in the design of operations and appropriate timing of actions. 2) The CAS for fiscal year 2001-04 should continue to support access to education. 3) The CAS should continue to support private sector development and financial markets.",Country :  Uruguay,Content Type : Reports,"November 8, 2000

Albania - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2006-09 : IEG review, Web Resource,"This review examines the
            implementation of the FY2006-09 Albania country assistance
            strategy (CAS), joint with International Finance Corporation
            (IFC), and evaluates the CAS completion report (CR). The
            Albania FY2006-09 CAS was highly relevant to and closely
            aligned with the country's policy priorities as spelled
            out in the national strategy for development and integration
            (2007). It consisted of two pillars: (a) fostering economic
            growth through support to private sector development; and
            (b) improving public service delivery, particularly in the
            social sectors. Improving governance and strengthening
            accountability mechanisms were the cross-cutting objectives
            of the program. Although the CAS progress report (PR) noted
            progress in a number of areas, it underscored that effective
            implementation of some interventions remained constrained by
            weaknesses in public administration. The CASPR thus sought
            to adjust the strategy to address macroeconomic challenges
            related to governance and institutional development in
            public administration; fiscal policy; and energy sector

            CPS had centered its program around three pillars which were
            to: (a) enable income and employment-generating growth; (b)
            improves human development and social protection; and (c)
            strengthen efficiency in public services. Addressing
            corruption and governance issues was a cross-cutting theme
            that was to be addressed in each of the pillars. Under
            pillar one, there was an improvement in private sector
            development through reduction in cost of opening a business,
            improving customs, and reducing the tax burden on
            businesses. Under pillar two, the targets in the CPS for the

            These reforms included implementing a new national
            curriculum, improving capacity to monitor education quality

            increases in primary school enrollment, and the reduction in
            infant and maternal mortality. The government, which runs

            consultant-driven, and it was never really ""owned""
            by the Borrower. Project implementation was made more
            difficult by frequent changes of government, and high
            turnover on both the Bank and Borrower side. Overall project
            outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Rating overall

            of the loan can be lost or 0ified by much larger forces
            which operate on the economy. The discussion which led to
            this program loan began at a time when the world copper
            prices had been relatively low for some two years, after

Armenia: Country Assistance Evaluation, PDF file,"At independence in 1991, Armenia had not yet recovered from a devastating earthquake in 1988. Then, the loss of traditional Soviet markets, severe shortages of foreign exchange, large increases in the price of imported energy, and armed conflict combined to lead to an especially desperate economic situation. Between 1990 and 1993 GDP dropped by more than 50 percent. The collapse of the economy led to an unprecedented fiscal crisis and hyperinflation. The government quickly initiated price liberalization, deregulation, and land reform, and economic reform increased in both pace and breadth in 1994 as the international community became increasingly involved. The economy began a steady recovery in 1994 and stabilized by 1995. Armenia has received substantial Bank assistance, both financial and through analytical and advisory work. Among the projects evaluated, 86 percent were rated as having satisfactory outcomes, exceeding both the Bank
and the Regional averages. OED rates the outcome of the Bank's overall assistance strategy as satisfactory. Bank assistance should now focus on improvements in the environment for private sector development and on support for public sector reform. Together, progress in these areas can generate the job-creating growth and
export expansion necessary to sustain progress.",Country :  Armenia,Content Type : Reports,"September 14, 2004

            International Development Association (IDA) program was
            implemented with some modifications relative to plans in the
            FY03-05 CAS. The first two operations of a planned sequence
            of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) were processed,
            although the Bank reduced the amount of both operations to
            reflect less-than-anticipated progress on reforms in certain
            areas. The post-election crisis in 2005, and the Bank~^!!^s
            subsequent decision to replace direct budget support under
            PRSCs with a different modality for delivering financial
            support, the Protection of Basic Services (PBS) project,
            also entailed the postponement of the full CAS that had
            initially been planned for FY06-08. Instead, an ICAS was
            processed, which adjusted the Bank~^!!^s program and made
            strengthening governance the priority overarching theme.
            Overall, the IDA program provided US$2.3 billion to Ethiopia
            over the period covered in this CASCR Review, ranking the
            country as the fifth-largest IDA borrower in the world and
            the largest in Africa. Beyond IDA funding, the Bank~^!!^s
            analytical work was generally of good quality, although on
            occasion it could have been used more effectively to table
            policy disagreements with the Government as well as options
            for bridging them. International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            was largely absent from Ethiopia during the period covered
            by this CASCR review. The CASCR highlights the need to: (i)
            enhance transparency and accountability in IDA program
            implementation; (ii) resume budgetary support; and (iii)
            strengthen the focus on results. IEG concurs largely with
            this analysis, while noting inter alia that: (a) to ensure
            effective resumption of budgetary support, Bank efforts to
            persuade the Government to broaden and deepen reforms need
            to be underpinned more strongly by analytical work and
            forceful dialogue on key drivers of growth; and (b) to
            ensure that the outcome of poverty reduction and social
            progress is correctly monitored on a timely basis, a good
            Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) function is essential. ", ,Content Type : Reports,"April 23, 2008

Bosnia and Herzegovina - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2005-07 : IEG review, Web Resource,"This review assesses the
            implementation of the FY08-11 Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH)
            CPS, as well as the CPS completion report. The strategy was
            jointly implemented by IBRD/IDA, IFC and MIGA, and this
            review covers the joint program of the three agencies. iBiH
            is a post-conflict state, whose governing structure
            complicates decision making and is prone to slow policy
            making and implementation. Poverty remains high for a
            European country, and political tensions have slowed
            progress towards EU accession, to which BiH aspires. The CPS
            and CPSPR were well aligned with BiH’s strategy, focusing on
            two pillars: improving the environment for private sector
            led growth; and improving the quality of government spending
            and delivery of public services. Pillar 1 WBG assistance
            helped improve key infrastructure, partially succeeded in
            accelerating corporate restructuring and privatization, and
            had marginal success in improving the business climate.
            Under Pillar 2, WBG assistance helped deliver better
            municipal services and primary healthcare, and partially
            succeeded in strengthening municipal finance and reducing
            urban-rural income disparities. But the targeting of social
            services did not improve as expected under the program.
            Moreover, contrary to program objectives, government
            spending as a share of GDP increased (in part due to the
            2008-9 financial crisis), while fiscal coordination among
            the entities that make up BiH has suffered setbacks. On
            balance, IEG rates the outcome of the WBG’s program as a
            whole as moderately satisfactory. This review has three
            recommendations. The WBG could explore ways of dealing
            effectively with the political stalemate between the
            entities in program implementation, beyond the distinction
            between core and non-core areas. Second, strategy objectives
            could be better linked to the interventions of the program.
            Most projects completed in the evaluation period and
            assessed by IEG were rated satisfactory or moderately
            satisfactory, but a close review of achievement of CPS
            objectives in the respective areas shows a less rosy
            picture. This suggests that objectives were over-ambitious
            given the interventions that were programmed, or that the
            chosen interventions were not the right ones for the
            objectives. Third, on strategy implementation, the WBG could
            do better by improving its understanding of the binding
            constraints on private sector development in BiH, and
            structuring its interventions accordingly. ",Country :  Bosnia and Herzegovina,Content Type : Reports,"November 1, 2007

China - Country partnership strategy : Country assistance strategy completion report - IEG review, Web Resource,"Progress towards the main objectives
            of the FY03-05 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) - improving

            poorer and disadvantaged people and lagging regions, and

            in terms of progress towards the main objectives of the CAS
            is rated satisfactory. Bank performance in terms of the
            support to China is rated as satisfactory. Important
            achievements were high quality analysis and capacity
            building related to China~^!!^s accession to the World Trade
            Organization and its impact on poverty, contribution to
            greater government focus on poverty, capital market
            development, greater government awareness of resource
            scarcity and environmental management, greater openness and
            transparency in project management, and the drafting of the
            Rural Land Contracting Law. Despite these achievements,
            several crucial challenges persist: better public sector
            management, improved service delivery by public utilities,
            adequate poverty targeting, managing the interaction among
            different tiers of government, improving health outcomes,
            and achieving environmentally sustainable growth.
            China~^!!^s portfolio - the Bank~^!!^s largest - exhibited
            excellent implementation during the CAS period with 90
            percent of projects rated as satisfactory. The Independent
            Evaluation Group (IEG) agrees with the main lessons of the
            Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR), in
            particular the need to further simplify and streamline Bank
            processes, actively work with other development partners to
            enhance Bank engagement in poverty reduction, social
            sectors, and the environment, and refine the process by
            which successful innovations and ideas are scaled up. While
            IEG concurs that results should be assessed more effectively
            through the introduction of a set of intermediate indicators
            (in addition to overall outcomes), these indicators should
            be tied to the Banks instruments and thus complement an
            assessment of overall results. IEG recommends that a more
            systematic approach be put in place to assess the utility of
            Analytical and Advisory Assistance, and more deliberate
            attempts be made to extract lessons from demonstration
            projects in order to further understand the determinants of
            success before scaling up. In addition, to the extent that
            data weaknesses preclude a timely and precise assessment if
            progress, it would be useful to establish how such
            information might be collected in the future. ",Country :  China,Content Type : Reports,"May 15, 2006

Cameroon - Cocoa Project, Web Resource,"This report is a performance audit on
            the Cocoa Project in Cameroon. The audit concurs with the
            principal findings of the PCR and shares its conclusions.
            Project implementation during the first two years was
            reasonably satisfactory, but in time a series of problems
            seriously affected project performance. Incremental
            production was minimal and the rate of return at completion
            has been assessed to be negative. The broad objectives of
            the project were to improve the livelihood of farmers in the
            project area by substantially increasing cocoa production,
            and to demonstrate that the development and rehabilitation
            of the cocoa sector was possible by replicating the project
            or its successful components. The project failed in these
            objectives. It is noted that project cost was
            underestimated, project area increased, and Government
            provided a large amount of money to cover the cost overruns.
            For these reasons, the results are not directly comparable
            with appraisal estimates. In this respect, the monitoring of
            the project was largely ineffective, and many of the
            physical results are of an estimated nature or open to
            argument. The extension service was of limited
            effectiveness. Its weakness in some measure reflected the
            frustrations from Government's confusing and sometimes
            obstructive role in regard to supply of inputs, pricing, and
            cooperative organization. However, later on its impact
            improved significantly. The production results are beset
            with uncertainties and incompleteness. The Borrower's

            implementation period. The lessons learned from the project
            may be expected to have an important impact on agriculture
            development in Cameroon. The project demonstrated, among
            other things, that further substantial growth would have to
            come from planting new areas, and not primarily from
            intensified production. Secondly, that prospective cocoa

"Timor-Leste Country Program Evaluation, 2000-2010", PDF file,"The World Bank Group (WBG) strategy in Timor-Leste during 2000-10 was articulated in a series of documents; The Joint Assessment Mission Report (Dec 1999) which formed the basis of the Bank's initial interventions; a Transitional Support Strategy (Nov. 2000), which covered the period until Timor-Leste became eligible to apply for membership of IBRD/IDA (May 2002); a Country Assistance Strategy (June 2005) outlining the strategy for the period FY06-08;  and a Interim Strategy Note (Aug. 2009) defined the strategy of the WBG for the period FY10-11. 
Throughout these strategy documents, the WBG planned to support Timor-Leste in three broad areas: (a) poverty alleviation and the provision of basic social services, including health and education; (b) development of state institutions, including creating good governance and building the capacity of state institutions; and (c) promoting sustainable nonpetroleum growth, especially through the development of agriculture and the private sector.
The relevance of the WBG strategy waned through the evaluation period, despite being broadly congruent with the country's own aspirations. During the first three years, the WBG strategy was relevant, focusing on immediate reconstruction needs, the restoration of key social services and alleviation of basic deprivation. At that time the Bank was the trustee and co-manager of the Trust Fund for East Timor, which brought together resources from different donors and funded investments through grants. As years went by, this immediate focus dissipated. The strategy became more diffuse and all-inclusive, covering a very broad front to the detriment of the most critical areas such as agriculture and capacity-building of state institutions. 
WBG support increasingly took the form of development policy operations and extensive analytical and advisory services. The WBG failed to respond to critical social challenges arising from youth unemployment and rising poverty, as the initial emphasis on delivering early tangible benefits to the population lost momentum. The efficacy of the program varied over time and by sector. The Bank performed relatively well in the early reconstruction period, when conditions were most challenging. 
As a result, access to basic health and education services improved and dire human deprivation was mitigated. Thereafter, measured against the objectives set by the WBG for itself, the results of its interventions with respect to long-term development challenges became much more uneven. Overall, moderately satisfactory outcomes in health and veterans' issues and highly satisfactory outcomes in the petroleum sector were offset by weak outcomes in other areas covered by the WBG program.
Despite the priority accorded throughout the succession of WBG strategy documents to agriculture, private sector development and employment generation, very little was achieved after the initial period of reconstruction and stabilization. Progress in improving governance and building state institutions, another priority area for the WBG, was good in some respects, but in others opportunities for greater impact were missed. Overall, the outcome of the WBG's program was Moderately Unsatisfactory when rated against the goals that it set for itself.",Country :  Timor-Leste,Content Type : Reports,"April 29, 2011

It finds that overall, the Bank and the rest of the donor community implemented similar strategies toward adult literacy since the 1990s and obtained similar results. Compared to earlier projects, designs have become more elaborate, focused on organizational effectiveness and financial viability.  Women are targeted and reached effectively.  Literacy efforts have moved from vertical government-only campaigns to strong institutional development, culturally sensitive textbooks, NGO participation, faire faire, and reliance on community and group demand for income generation.

The project aimed to pilot test participatory approaches to improve land use and natural resource management in the High Atlas Mountains. More than 2 million peopleâamong the poorest in Moroccoâlive in the Lakhdar Watershed, using agricultural practices that rely on environmentally destructive techniques. These have resulted in a substantial decline in agricultural production and increased risk of flooding. The project benefited from lessons from a 1995 Watershed Management Project. 
IEG rated the overall outcome as satisfactory. IEG rated the risk to development outcome as significant; there was a lack of a monitoring system to track results or replication, and no follow-on operation was implemented. IEG rated both Bank and borrower performance as satisfactory. IEG saw several lessons from the LWMPP: Communities need to see results early, which requires active community involvement, including local authorities. Such projects generally are slow to build momentum and if abandoned will make subsequent development efforts more difficult. With environmental objectives, it is important to measure at least local impacts. And for pilot projects, monitoring and evaluation is a must.",Country :  Morocco,Content Type : Reports,"June 1, 2009

            Progress Report (CPSPR) and their implementation, and
            evaluates the CPS Completion Report. The review covers both
            IBRD and IFC activities. The main objectives of the World
            Bank Group's strategy, which followed the poverty
            reduction support paper (PRSP), were grouped under the
            following four pillars: (i) improve the quality and

            and access to social services; and (iv) improve
            environmental management and further the climate change
            agenda. The strategy viewed this support as forming a
            governance action plan cutting across the various areas
            covered by the pillars. IEG highlights two lessons. First, a
            more focused strategy will have allowed the World Bank Group
            to zero in on a few issues and provide effective support,
            with good quality advice for a fruitful policy dialogue.

            mainstreaming of biodiversity across sectors, both public
            and private, is strong ownership and active participation

            economic, and territorial contexts of the geographic area in
            which a project is seeking to establish new or expand
            existing protected areas is essential to properly gauge the
            possibilities of achieving such an objective. (iii)
            Experience in Brazil (and elsewhere) has shown that
            government commitment to project objectives and design can
            shift significantly over time due to changes in
            administrations, both at the federal and state government
            levels. (iv) Learning from environment projects that use

            is rated unsatisfactory, in view of the project's low
            quality at entry. OED also rates Borrower performance
            unsatisfactory, owing to WAPDA'spoor record on
            implementation and the government's failure to address
            the lack of financial incentive for WAPDA. Project
            experience confirms a number of lessons: First, thorough
            project preparation is essential. This project failed
            because, at appraisal, it was not feasible economically,
            financially, or institutionally. Implementation will
            inevitably be unsatisfactory unless the required preparatory
            studies and reviews are carried out in advance, and unless
            implementation procedures and monitoring and coordination
            requirements are spelt out in appraisal reports, and agreed
            prior to start-up. Second, a project will fail to meet
            targets if the incentives are wrong. Third, tariff analysis
            is fundamental in public utility projects. ",Country :  Pakistan,Content Type : Reports,"June 14, 2001

Hungary - Second Transport Project and Roads Project, Web Resource,"The audit rates the outcome of the
            Second Transport Project as satisfactory because the
            objectives were relevant, investments were efficient, and
            efficacy was mixed. The outcome of the Roads Project is
            downgraded to moderately satisfactory: while the economic
            return was above 12 percent, network deterioration has
            continued. The following lessons emerge from the two
            projects: 1) Road maintenance in transitional, Central
            European economies becomes especially critical because of
            high diversion of traffic from rail to road and growth in
            motorization and in heavy truck traffic. 2) Government
            commitment to competitive bidding needs to be strongly
            enforced to prevent civil works contracts financed with
            public funds from being awarded on a negotiated basis, as is
            now occurring with the implementation of the national
            motorway program. 3) A tradition of considering most
            transport services ""natural monopolies"" slows
            their reform. In formulating transport policies, countries
            should take into account recent international experience
            showing that modern forms of sectoral organization allow
            greater competition. 4) Hungary's success with reducing
            road accidents suggests the key to success lies in the
            enforcement of road safety legislation, through a strong
            commitment and coordination between the government agencies
            responsible for the police and for the road system. ",Country :  Hungary,Content Type : Reports,"May 16, 2001

Indonesia - Central and West Java Provincial Irrigation Development Project and Second Irrigation Subsector Project, Web Resource,"The audit covers both the Central and
            West Java Provincial Irrigation Development (CWJIP) and the
            Second Irrigation Sub-Sector (ISSP-II) projects. Both
            projects are assessed as marginally satisfactory, with
            uncertain sustainability. While both operations were
            successful in transferring technical knowledge, weak
            conditions for sustainable operation and maintenance
            (O&M) in the CWJIP, and its failure in the ISSP-II,
            contributed to this assessment. The performance of both the
            Bank and the borrower regarding the CWJIP was satisfactory.
            However, both performances were unsatisfactory regarding the
            ISSP-II, since both parties dealt too lightly with project
            design, on issues such as financial governance,
            accountability, and, decentralization, failing to resolve
            during implementation. The lessons learned suggest that
            under situations where the Bank is not fundamentally engaged
            in sector reforms, O&M improvement projects should be
            conducted in the simplest, feasible technical, and
            institutional manner. Likewise, complex operations, aiming
            at efficient O&M, should also consider its service
            suppliers' incentives and financial governance. While
            it is not advisable to split implementation responsibilities
            among ministries, particularly in those countries with a
            centralized bureaucracy, the lack of staff continuity, is
            definitely detrimental to success, for, unresolved sector
            and policy issues remain, underlying decades of political
            and institutional problems. ",Country :  Indonesia,Content Type : Reports,"June 30, 1999

Jordan - Human Resources Development Sector Investment Loan and Seventh Education Projects, Web Resource,"This audit report rates the outcome
            of the projects as satisfactory, given the many successful
            achievements in complex areas, even though the full impact
            cannot be assessed until the wider program is completed. The
            institutional development impact is rated as modest, in view
            of uneven, and partial accomplishments in this field, and,
            with no institutional changes in most schools. Contrary to
            the assessment at project completion, the audit rates
            sustainability as uncertain, considering current risks are
            higher, such as pressing concerns on the fiscal and
            budgetary situations, as well as donor assistance, coupled
            with the possibility of priority changes under the new
            government. Regardless of these shortcomings, the ratings
            for the Bank and the Borrower, were satisfactory. The key
            lessons include: 1) Under prevailing weaknesses in financial
            accounting, the instrument to limit disbursements to
            approved subprojects, was probably an asset, since financial
            risks were minimized. 2) The subproject approach proved
            effective, since it allowed experience to grow, develop
            skills at the central government level, and strengthen
            ownership. 3) However, the subproject mechanism had its
            limitations, for, since teamwork had no lasting effect,
            competition may have increased in non-functional ways. 4)
            Emphasis should be placed in sharing administrative and
            financial procedures, particularly, with non-project staff,
            to avoid unnecessary tensions. ",Country :  Jordan,Content Type : Reports,"June 29, 1999

            utility supplying electricity countrywide except in the main

            (PCR) prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations
            Division of the Southern Africa Department and already

            Livestock Development Project in Ireland. The performance of
            Agricultural Credit Corporation Ltd (ACC) as borrower and

"Addressing groundwater depletion: Lessons from India, the world’s largest user of groundwater", Web Resource,"India is home to 16% of the world’s population, but only holds 4% of the world’s freshwater resources.

Not only is water scarce in India, but the extraction of groundwater has been on the rise for decades. Since the 1960s, the government’s support for the “green revolution” to ensure food security has increased the demand for groundwater for agriculture. Rapid rural electrification combined with the availability of modern pump technologies has led to an increase in the number of borewells to meet that demand. Over the last 50 years, the number of borewells has grown from 1 million to 20 million, making India the world’s largest user of groundwater.

The Central Groundwater Board of India estimates that about 17% of groundwater blocks are overexploited (meaning the rate at which water is extracted exceeds the rate at which the aquifer is able to recharge) while 5% and 14% , respectively, are at critical and semi-critical stages. The situation is particularly alarming in three major regions – north-western, western, and southern peninsular.

Groundwater pollution and the effects of climate change, including erratic rainfall in the drier areas, put additional stress on groundwater resources which serve about 85% of domestic water supply in rural areas, 45% in urban areas, and over 60% of irrigated agriculture. Current overexploitation rates pose threats to livelihoods, food security, climate-driven migration, sustainable poverty reduction and urban development.

The World Bank has been working with the Government of India to enhance groundwater management in affected areas. The lessons below stem from the experience of World Bank groundwater management projects in India, and are part of a broader IEG evaluation of the World Bank’s support for sustainable and inclusive natural resource management.  

Integrated demand and supply side solutions offer the best option for sustainable use. IEG case studies in Rajasthan, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh showed that the success of supply-side measures, such as watershed management programs, aquifer recharging and tank rehabilitation activities, did not lead to sustainable use in the absence of demand-side action. Measures such as surface water harvesting through farm ponds and check-dams, the installation of water-efficient irrigation systems (e.g. more efficient drips and sprinklers) and growing less water intensive crops, need to be integrated on the demand side for improved management and reduced depletion.

Weak regulatory action to limit demand for groundwater can hinder the success of programs in reversing groundwater depletion. Weak regulations result in the expansion of groundwater irrigated areas and drilling of additional wells. This can more than offset water savings created by demand-side measures, or the water increases created by supply-side measures, leading to further depletion. The government of India regulates groundwater exploitation in water-stressed states through “notification” of highly overexploited blocks that restrict development of new groundwater structures (except those for drinking water). However, only about 14% of the overexploited blocks in the country are currently notified. Local level regulatory action in all threatened blocks before they reach the “overexploited” stage is vital to avert depletion.

Strengthening community participation and rights in groundwater governance can improve groundwater management. World Bank projects in peninsular India, where more spread out and specifically defined hydrological sites prevail, were successful on several fronts by implementing the Participatory Groundwater Management approach (PGM). The PGM approach empowers communities in a defined aquifer area by providing governance rights, community awareness, capacity development, and knowledge and motivation for social regulation and the implementation of coordinated actions.

However, there are limits to the success of the PGM approach. It did not work when local institutions were weak, supply-side interventions failed to replenish groundwater or when tanks failed to store water due to recurrent droughts, leading to increased overexploitation. The approach is also unlikely to work in areas with extensive alluvial aquifers that require coordination among large numbers of users.

World Bank interventions support local institutional capacity for groundwater governance, but such institutions are often not viable after the end of the project. Two local institutions are mainly involved in groundwater management in India: Water User Associations (WUA) and groundwater management committees (GWMC). WUAs are formal institutions with a wider mandate to manage irrigation systems (surface and groundwater) and have budget allocations for maintaining the systems and collecting user charges. In contrast, GWMCs are informal groups created through World Bank–supported projects to facilitate PGM. These committees become dormant and dysfunctional once projects close. The key institutional challenge for groundwater governance is strengthening local institutions and helping the informal groups to remain viable during the post-project phase.

Power subsidies for pumping groundwater accelerate the depletion of aquifers in stressed areas. Several states affected by depletion of groundwater provide free or heavily subsidized power (including solar pumps) for pumping groundwater for irrigated agriculture. This creates perverse incentives that enable overexploitation and depletion of scarce groundwater resources. In the long-run, sustainable groundwater management will depend on cross-sectoral reforms to address the water-energy-agriculture nexus and providing the right incentives to resource users. This requires better coordination of policy, market and regulatory measures as well as repurposing current distortive public support to more climate-smart solutions. Strengthening World Bank analytical support and investments in these directions would be useful for future.

Groundwater extraction has allowed rural families to reduce short-term vulnerability but may incur trade-offs and increase the risk of depletion and ultimately increase vulnerability in the long term. Increased access to groundwater resources and extraction allows households to boost agricultural production in the short term. Many farm households owning wells indicated that their vulnerability is lower partly because of income growth and diversification and buffers provided by social safety nets. However, without sufficient regulation or replenishment of aquifers, the increased access to and use of groundwater for irrigation could lead to declining water tables and increasing water scarcity, which risks escalating long-term vulnerability.

Building on what is already there: Africa launch of the Global Evaluation Initiative, Web Resource,"“The monitoring and evaluation process is essential for governance and the development of evidence-based policies,” announced Mozambique Vice Minster of Finance Dr. Carla Alexandra Oreste do Rosário Fernandes Louveir at the start of a virtual conference focused on the launch of the Global Evaluation Initiative and its potential role in Africa. “Monitoring and evaluation are powerful decision-making tools for managers,” added the Vice Minister.

The Global Evaluation Initiative (GEI) brings together a broad and inclusive coalition of governments, citizens and experts to close a global gap in monitoring and evaluation capacities. According to a recent report, more than half of all countries now have high-quality national development strategies and almost all of them are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but only one third of them have data and systems to track implementation of their policies.

Responding to an urgent need

A sense of urgency was palpable during the launch event, “Evidence and the Road to 2030,” which brought together government and independent evaluation experts from across Africa, as well as representatives of international organizations and donor countries. The Sustainable Development Goals were already off track as the 10-year countdown to the 2030 Agenda began this year, and the COVID-19 pandemic is derailing them further, threatening to push millions into poverty.

“We need reliable evidence to guide our path to economic recovery, “ said event participant Godfrey Mashamba, South Africa’s Deputy Director General of the Department of Planning and Monitoring and Evaluation.

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) can deliver invaluable evidence on what is working and what is not. They can be a powerful compass, helping governments learn from experience and use the lessons to adjust course, scale or target public policies more effectively. There is strong demand from countries in Africa and around the world to strengthen their M&E capacities as critical for rebuilding better from the pandemic and getting back on track to the SDGs.

Linking national, regional and global knowledge

GEI aims to respond to the demand by building on the capacities, experiences and knowledge of local actors and matching these with coordinated support and global knowledge, according to representatives of two organizations at the heart of the  partnership who spoke during the event: Alison Evans, Director-General of Evaluation at the World Bank Group, and Oscar A. Garcia, Director of the Independent Evaluation Office of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

For example, Cabo Verde, a small country of 10 islands off Western Africa, has many sources of data but does not yet have the institutional capacity to process and take advantage of this information, according to panelist Gilson Pina, National Director of Planning at the Cabo Verde Ministry of Finance. GEI will help train and build the capacities of staff to use the data of a new M&E platform that his planning department is building, Pina said.

“The initiative’s goals coincide with our own goals,” Pina said during his intervention at the conference.

Beyond building basic capacity, GEI should serve to “support a culture of evaluation” and encourage shared progress for African countries, said panelist Abdoulaye Gounou, Head of Benin’s Office for the Evaluation of Public Policies and Analysis of Government Action.

“The partnership on evaluation is a very powerful tool for institutionalizing and promoting evaluation in our countries,” Gounou said. “We are learning through our peers and we are progressing together.”

Independent evaluators in Africa can also play a role in expanding M&E capacities in the region and developing African approaches to evaluation, said panelist Fazeela Hoosen, co-chair of the Young and Emerging Evaluators Network of the African Evaluation Association. As the next generation of evaluators, “Young and emerging evaluators are the ground or fertile soil to embed the seeds of what we have been talking about,” she said.

Regional and global cooperation

GEI aims to collaborate with the diverse set of stakeholders involved in the development of M&E capacity, from government officials to independent evaluators, and to serve as a global platform for the curating and sharing of local and global M&E knowledge. The partnership has already been in touch with the African Evaluation Association (AfrEA), an umbrella organization for individual evaluators in countries that lack national evaluation associations, said panelist Rosetti Nabbumba of Uganda, president of AfrEA’s Board of Directors. GEI has begun talking with AfrEA about working together to compile a database of African evaluators.

“I’m looking forward to a very collaborative arrangement,” with GEI, Nabbumba said.

The Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) also has high expectations for GEI, with the hope that it will take the evaluation capacity agenda forward with a focus on country-led efforts according to panelist Pernilla Rafiqui, Sida’s Senior Program Manager for Capacity Development.

Rafiqui described GEI as “both timely and well conceptualized,” and added, “we expect GEI to contribute toward better policies for better lives for poor and vulnerable people, and we very much look forward to making this happen.”

In closing remarks, Dr. Anthony Akoto Osei, Ghana’s Minister for Monitoring and Evaluation, emphasized the urgent need in the uncertain context of COVID-19 for robust M&E systems that enhance the chances of success of government policies.

“The need for and use of evidence in support of decision-making have never been as important as it is now,” Dr. Osei said. “The required improvements in M&E need to be underpinned by what is already in place. The GEI is an example of that kind of strategy, in that it seeks to build on what is already there, and to operate collaboratively and through partnerships.”

Vietnam - Completion and learning review of the country partnership framework for the period FY12-16 : IEG review, Web Resource,"Vietnam is a lower middle income
            country with a GNI per capita income of USD 1,990 in 2015.
            During the review period, the country continued to
            experience rapid GDP growth averaging 5.8 percent, compared
            to 4.3 percent for the East Asia and Pacific region as a
            whole. This is the first WBG Country Partnership Strategy
            (CPS) for Vietnam after it had become a lower middle-income
            country in 2009. The CPS was well aligned with the
            government’s objectives and stated development goals. It
            supported the implementation of the government’s Socio-
            Economic Development Strategy (SEDS, 2011-20) as this was
            operationalized in the Socio-Economic Development Plan
            (2011-15). The SEDS focused on structural reform,
            environmental sustainability, and the then emerging issues
            of macro-economic stability, with three core areas:
            promoting human resources and skills development, improving
            market institutions, and infrastructure development.
            Macroeconomic stability, and poverty was increasingly being
            concentrated in ethnic minority communities. In line with
            these concerns, the WBG through the CPS and the Progress
            Learning Review (PLR) focused on partnering with Vietnam to
            help the country achieve success as a middle income country
            with three focus areas: Competitiveness, Sustainability, and
            Opportunity. The CLR identifies a number of lessons, with
            which IEG mostly agrees. Most importantly: (i) Achieving
            selectivity requires strong engagement with the government.
            (ii) Comprehensive and programmatic engagement enhances the
            impact of engagement. (iii) Cross-sectoral, holistic
            approaches should be adopted and implemented more
            frequently. (iv) Expectations must be carefully calibrated
            when it comes to structural or transformational reform areas
            – also noting the importance of understanding the political
            economy aspects. (v) The WBG can use more effectively its
            convening power. IEG adds three key lessons from this CPS:
            First, in Vietnam going forward there is room for greater
            concentration of resources, including more emphasis on
            selectivity and with fewer but on average larger lending
            operations. The selectivity of the knowledge program could
            probably also be enhanced. Second, it is also important to
            pay more attention to the design of the results framework,
            including the balance between objectives and their under
            pinning outcomes and indicators, and for program
            additionally to be clearer, beyond the expected results of
            individual operations. Third, updating of the results
            framework at the PLR is an essential element of proactive
            program management and would need to be used effectively,
            including the continued monitoring and reporting of results
            throughout the CPS period. ",Country :  Vietnam,Content Type : Reports,"May 17, 2017

            complex challenges, such as child nutrition, is beyond the
            scope of the health sector by itself and requires a
            multi-sectoral approach. The World Bank can play a role in
            convening development partners and to ensure that the
            evidence is shared across different sectors, in much the
            same way that was done with human immunodeficiency virus
            (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the
            three ones approach. Not having a clear development
            objective can impact negatively on implementation and
            results. The lack of intervention-level evaluations limits
            the programs flexibility and responsiveness. While
            monitoring and evaluation is important for accountability,
            it can also help to understand what works well in the

            seems unlikely that there will be structural reform in the

            (though marginally so) principally on account of poor

            the adoption of policies and strategies leading to the
            proper management of oil wealth through adjustment or sector
            loans. Negotiated contracts need to incorporate time and

            developing, and transition economies; thus, exposure to
            early success stories in the country, or outside is crucial.
            Second, the particular private sector participation option
            is determined by the government's political readiness.
            While some reforms are better suited than others at
            improving the transport sector, and eliciting maximum
            private investment, the reform option adopted depends on the
            government's will, and readiness for such particular
            reform option, as well as on its capacity to pursue it.
            Third, negotiations between the conceding authority, and
            preferred bidder can improve the terms of concession, when
            response from competitive tendering is inadequate.
            Interestingly, regardless of the inappropriateness of
            ex-post negotiations given the potential vulnerability to
            unfairness, in light of few bidders in the tendering

            to a project that was able to generate strong positivie
            financial flows both in housing and in local government.
            Both Borrower performance and World Bank performance are
            rated satisfactory, given the high professional standards
            and leadership applied to the project. Key lessons learned
            focus on leadership and high-quality staffing, and strong
            revenue flows: Project success was assured by leadership
            skills and sensitivities on both the Borrower and Bank
            sides. The Bank's task manager at appraisal was willing
            to take risks with an approach to housing untried in the
            country. Key Ghanaian professionals were open to new ideas
            on housing and urban management. Secondly, when a project
            agency with strong revenue flows of its own--whatever the
            source--could become a confident interlocutor and a more
            effective instrument of reform. As a partner for reform, the
            agency's impact could be scaled up if profits from more
            buoyant product lines could cross-subsidize reform-led
            expenditures aimed at weaker market demands by the poor as
            in this case. ",Country :  Ghana,Content Type : Reports,"May 30, 2001

Romania - Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan Project and Social Protection Adjustment Loan Project, Web Resource,"The outcome of both the Financial and
            Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (FESAL) Project and the
            Social Protection Adjustment Loan (SPAL) Project were rated
            as marginally satisfactory. Specific lessons emerge from the
            two projects include: 1) The design of the SPAL was weighted
            excessively toward short-term palliatives rather than
            structural improvements in the safety net. 2) Both loans
            included too many areas of reform and conditions. 3) Many
            FESAL and SPAL conditions were linked to processes, such as
            design and implementation of plans and report preparation,
            or to outcomes that are difficult to measure, such as
            ""achieving substantial progress"" in reform. As a
            result, monitoring performance became difficult and time
            consuming. 4) Government ownership, delivery capacity, and
            control over program implementation were inadequate for
            FESAL, especially for the revised program of 1997.
            Government ownership and participation were greater for
            SPAL, and existing programs and structures were used. 5)
            Reform programs requiring legal changes must carefully
            assess the legislative, legal and judicial system's
            ability to facilitate program implementation. Where
            impediments exist, the process and system should be
            strengthened through a separate project. 6) Privatization
            targets should focus on the percentage of state-owned assets
            actually transferred to private ownership and control. ",Country :  Romania,Content Type : Reports,"February 16, 2001

The Power to Renew: Evaluation of the World Bank Group’s Support to Electricity Supply from Renewable Energy Resources (Approach Paper), PDF file,"This report evaluates how effectively the World Bank Group (WBG) has supported clients navigate an evolving market for renewable energy (RE) for supplying electricity to meet energy and environmental needs. It covers a dynamic period from 2000 to 2017 during which RE markets for certain technologies evolved considerably, and there was a marked scale-up of WBG activities in the sector. The evaluation will help determine the ability of WBG to adjust its interventions to rapidly changing conditions and deliver state-of-the-art RE solutions to clients. The evaluation is being undertaken at a time when both the international community and the WBG are placing considerable importance on RE as a key contributor to addressing global climate change. RE, which supports several global development priorities, is vital to achieving inclusive and sustainable economic growth, as per the Forward Look – A Vision for the World Bank Group in 2030. 
The primary audience for this evaluation is the WBG Board of Executive Directors and WBG management and operational staff. Other key audiences include development partners—especially bilateral donors and other MDBs, special partners—such as GEF, CIFs, and donors who fund ESMAP and ASTAE, WBG clients across governments and in the private sector, civil society organizations and beneficiaries impacted by the WBG’s RE activities.", ,Content Type : Reports,"October 26, 2019

Forests are home to some of the world's poorest people. Forests also provide environmental services important to the agriculture
sector such as hydrological regulation and pollination. Worldwide, the demand for forest products is expected to continue to grow.Therefore, appropriate policy and institutional responses are required to manage forests in a sustainable manner by balancing competing interests, addressing underlying failures in forest governance and clarifying tenure issues.The World Bank Group's (WBG) response has been most recently expressed in its 2002 Forest Strategy, Sustaining Forests â A Development Strategy, which identifies three pillars/objectives for its involvement in the sector: a.) Harnessing the potential of forests to reduce poverty; b.) Integrating forests in sustainable economic development; and c.) Protecting vital local and global environmental services and values.
IEG's  evaluation will take stock of the extent to which the WBG has been able to effectively make use of its experience and its resources to provide leadership in the sector.The evaluative questions will reflect the focus of the 2002 forest strategy and the evaluation will take into account the impact of the 2002 forest strategy and other internal factors on the extent, nature and effectiveness of the WBG's forest
activities.", ,Content Type : Reports,"October 19, 2011

Multi-Donor Trust Fund for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, PDF file,"The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) was launched at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 to encourage governments, companies involved in extractive industries, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and others to work together voluntarily to promote transparency of payments and revenues in order to address the paradoxical âresource curse,â which is that two-thirds of the world's poorest people live in countries that are rich in natural resources. Two related organizationsâEITI in Oslo and a Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF-EITI) in the World Bankâ work together to achieve shared objectives, with the MDTF-EITI providing technical assistance in support of country-level EITI processes. The EITI and MDTF-EITI are in the process of achieving their narrowly defined, specific objective of increasing transparency over payments and revenue from the extractive sector: 42 resource-rich countries have publicly endorsed the EITI process, and an additional 14 are at some stage in the endorsement process. But promoting transparency will only bring benefits if it can be linked to higher-order goals that will help resource-dependent countries address the resource curse in a way that contributes to reducing poverty. To show that EITI and MDTF-EITI can contribute to achieving tangible welfare benefits, in the form of improved revenue management and reduced corruption, for example, remains a challenge for the second phase of the programs.", ,Content Type : Reports,"February 1, 2011

An Impact Evaluation of India's Second and Third Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Projects - A Case of Poverty Reduction with Low Economic Returns, PDF file,"The widespread expansion of irrigated farming has largely removed the threat of malnutrition and premature death for millions around the world and has had demonstrated poverty-reduction effects. Nonetheless, large irrigation projects have fallen out of favor, criticized for their costliness, their environmental impacts, the resettlement problems they cause, and particularly their poor sustainability record.
IEG has examined the paradoxical nature of irrigation projects by evaluating the impact of two such projects in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Irrigation Projects II and III aimed to irrigate 393,000 hectares (ha) of landâ65,000 ha served by the Srisailam Right Bank Canal, 163,000 ha served by a rehabilitated canal, and 165,000 ha gained from extending the system under the Sriramasagar Project. Together these projects were expected to benefit more than 300,000 farm households. 
The evaluation found that irrigation project outcomes are restrained by the failure to meet overly ambitious construction schedules, and investment viability relies on overly optimistic estimates of benefits. This report supports the conclusion of IEG's recent sector study of irrigation, which states that the Bank has been overly optimistic regarding what may be achieved through WUAs and has underestimated the need for continued government involvement.",Country :  India,Content Type : Reports,"June 1, 2008

Zimbabwe Assistance Evaluation (Reach), PDF file,"Government policies in the 1980s brought social progress, but at the cost of unsustainable fiscal deficits and low growth. Land distribution remained highly unequal. In the 1990s, efforts to accelerate growth through better fiscal management and market liberalization largely failed. Social progress slowed, per capita incomes declined, and poverty increased. The outcome of Bank assistance during the past two decades is rated unsatisfactory. The Borrower showed little commitment to macroeconomic stability and poverty alleviation. It abandoned the rule of law and respect for property rights by forcibly acquiring land. In the 1980s, the Bank engaged in substantial investment lending which, however, was largely not oriented to reducing inequality. During the 1990s, the Bank engaged in policy lending, but with mixed results: progress on liberalization was not matched by improvement in macroeconomic stability. The Bank neglected to forcefully address the all-important land reform issue until late in 1998. Given the arrears situation, the Bank cannot lend even for a narrowly defined social agenda. AAA should focus on an assessment of poverty and inequality; an analysis of the political economy factors that have impeded reforms in the past; learning from pilots on land reform in other countries; and a
public expenditure review focused on fiscal sustainability and the required rationalization of public expenditures.",Country :  Zimbabwe,Content Type : Reports,"August 18, 2004

            their objectives, despite significant initial implementation
            problems in the case of the air quality, and the highway

            much progress can be achieved in reducing the impact of road

            and private sector measures, starting with an adequate
            system of incentives, put in place by federal, and state
            governments. Second, allocation of highway maintenance

            routine, and periodic maintenance over rehabilitation, but
            network condition is bound to deteriorate if funding for

Russian Federation - Health Reform Pilot Project, Web Resource ,"The objective of the Health Reform Pilot Project was to improve the quality and efficiency of health care and reproductive and cardiovascular health outcomes in two oblasts (regions) â Tver and Kaluga -- on a pilot basis to enable the Borrower to make decisions about national adoption of specific reform measures.  The project was to focus on: (a) changing incentive systems through the introduction of output-driven, cost-conscious provider payment mechanisms, accompanied by information-based quality assurance schemes; (b) strengthening primary care, centered on a network of family physicians, and reducing inpatient care services; and (c) improving practices in maternal and child health (MCH) and cardiovascular health, with an emphasis on promoting healthy lifestyles and offering better-quality, cost-effective, and affordable prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.  The start-up of the project was delayed by almost two years because of the August 1998 financial crisis.  Roughly half of the loan was cancelled, with several project activities not completed.   The project financed equipment and training that likely contributed to improving the quality of health care.  However, obstetrics, gynecology, and MCH were excluded from the family medicine curriculum and very little was spent on health promotion.  New models of health care financing were not uniformly implemented, continued to co-exist with the Soviet-era system and proved to have little staying power. The first objective of improving the quality and efficiency of health care and reproductive and cardiovascular health outcomes was generally not achieved.  While the average length of hospital stay, hospital beds (Kaluga only), the infant mortality and abortion rates improved in both oblasts, attribution to the project is doubtful, as these outcomes also improved in similar oblasts throughout the country.  Further, mortality from cardiovascular disease increased significantly in both pilot and non-pilot oblasts and the hospital beds per capita increased in Tver.  The hospital admission rate and percent of pregnant women with hypertension linked to pregnancy were unchanged in Tver and increased in Kaluga.  The objective of evaluating the pilot interventions to make informed decisions on expanding them nation-wide was not achieved.   The design included no systematic framework to assess the impact of project interventions against control groups and/or against the counterfactual.  The overall quality of monitoring, evaluation, and dissemination was poor, adversely affected by institutional and organizational changes. Analysis and national scale-up from the oblasts was therefore impossible.  The outcome of the HRPP is rated unsatisfactory overall, based on the moderately unsatisfactory outcome in improving reproductive and cardiovascular health and the quality and efficiency of health care, and the highly unsatisfactory effort to monitor, evaluate, and disseminate project outcomes.

            slowed down since 2013 thereby reducing the rate of decline
            in poverty. In addition to 29 million people below the
            poverty line, above it there are 65 million that are
            vulnerable. The government diagnosed the underlying causes
            of poverty and other problems in its development plan for
            2009-2014. The plan formulated the development priorities as
            a set of 13 priority areas which the government considered
            capable of answering a number of challenges faced by the
            nation and state in the future. The World Bank Group (WBG)
            strategy addressed some of these challenges in four focus

            Corporation (IFC). Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
            (MIGA) did not approve new guarantees during the CAS period.
            The review covers the joint program of IDA and IFC. The
            World Bank Group (WBG) strategy was formulated to help the
            country implement the country's Strategy for
            Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development (SCADD). The
            SCADD priorities reflected a continuation of the government
            strategic priorities up to that point. The WBG strategy
            aimed at contributing in two areas: minimizing economic
            vulnerability and promoting growth recovery through economic
            transformation, and sharing growth through improved social
            service delivery. Improving governance and developing
            capacity were crosscutting themes of the strategy. According
            to the CASCR, IFC and IDA coordinated closely to identify

            programs was disappointing. The FY2005 CAS was developed to
            support the Republic of Moldova's development program.
            The program it outlined focused on the growth and poverty
            reduction objectives of the Moldovan program via a

            percent by 2005. The CAS supported the four pillars of the
            Government's PRSP and focused on three crosscutting
            themes. The pillars were broad based growth and structural
            reform; investment in human capital; better protection for
            vulnerable groups; and improved governance and institutional
            development. The three cross-cutting themes were
            environment, social equity and decentralization. The FY06
            Interim Strategy Note (ISN) did not specify any objectives,
            but put greater emphasis on economic growth for poverty
            reduction. During the review period, IDA approved
            commitments for a total of US$264 million for 12 projects
            and completed 21 planned analytical reports. IFC invested U
            S 4 8 million in five projects and MlGA guaranteed four
            projects for US$105 million, and both provided technical
            assistance for competitiveness and investment and export
            promotion. IDA'S country assistance strategy and
            program supported Nicaragua's economic and social
            development goals and was relevant, realistic and
            achievable. The overall goal of reducing poverty was not
            achieved. Poverty remained static through the CAS period
            despite some economic growth and a substantial increase in
            expenditures on poverty, but they were not well targeted.

Mozambique - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2004-07 : IEG review, Web Resource,"This country assistance strategy
            completion report (CASCR) review examines the implementation
            of the FY2004-07 Mozambique CAS and evaluates the 2007
            CASCR. The FY2004 CAS was a results-based strategy prepared
            jointly with International Finance Corporation (IFC) and
            Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The CAS
            progress report (PR) presented a harmonization of the
            outcome indicators in the CAS and the retrofitted
            performance assessment framework of the poverty reduction
            strategy (PARPA) undertaken in 2006, but failed to explain
            the rationale for changes in individual indicators. The
            FY2004 CAS supported the development objectives of the
            government through the three pillars of the Mozambique
            poverty reduction strategy defined as: improving the
            investment climate, expanding service delivery, and building
            capacity and accountability. The Bank's program aimed
            to help achieve these objectives by providing United States
            (U.S.) 659.3 million dollars in 14 operations to Mozambique
            and producing a number of analytic and advisory services.
            This review rates the overall outcome of the implementation
            of the FY2004-07 CAS as moderately satisfactory, the same as
            the CASCR. Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) concurs with
            the lessons of the CASCR which touch on the need for better
            collaboration among International Development Association
            (IDA), IFC, and MIGA for strengthened support to private
            sector development; improved appreciation of the
            country's political economy during project design,
            timing, and implementation, especially with respect to

Albania - Country assistance strategy (CAS) completion report review, Web Resource,"The Albania country assistance
            strategy completion report (CASCR) evaluates the
            effectiveness of Bank assistance during FY2002-05, which was
            based on the CAS of May 28, 2002. The overall goals of the
            assistance were to improve governance and strengthen
            institutions to promote sustainable private sector growth,
            and to foster human development. While the independent
            evaluation group - World Bank (IEG-WB) country assistance
            evaluation (CAE) evaluated the Bank's assistance for
            the period FY1998-2004, its findings were applicable to the
            period of the assistance. Albania made gains in poverty
            alleviation, economic growth and price stability, roads,
            electricity, and the fiscal sustainability of the pension
            system. About 80 percent of the growth since 2000 has been
            driven by large gains in factor productivity, and a large
            flow of remittances (about 12 to 15 percent of gross
            domestic product (GDP)) from Albanians working abroad has
            contributed to smooth and sustain higher levels of
            consumption than it will have been possible otherwise.
            Albania also made progress in civil service reform and in
            urban water supply, when urgent rehabilitation measures of
            the system were carried out in four cities. IEG-WB agrees
            with the main findings of the CASCR, in particular the need
            to develop strategic frameworks, increase selectivity, adopt
            an outcomes oriented approach, and have governance permeate

Philippines - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) for the period FY2003-FY2005 : OED review, Web Resource,"This OED review of the FY03-05 CAS
            program and the CAS Completion Report (CASCR) finds that
            there was acceptable progress towards attaining the main
            objectives of the CAS program-macroeconomic stability and
            equitable growth, environmentally sustainable rural
            development, comprehensive human development through access
            to basic services, and good and effective governance-and the
            outcome of the Bank's assistance over this period is
            therefore rated moderately satisfactory. Philippine economic
            performance has improved with higher growth rates in recent
            years, but macroeconomic instability remains a concern,
            aggravated by public sector debt over 100 percent of GDP.
            The CAS program has been successful in assisting rural
            communities to access infrastructure, services and finance.
            Despite progress made in strengthening public fiscal
            management, public procurement in particular, and
            transparency, major weaknesses remains in the structures of
            public administration, public expenditure management and
            civil service. This review finds that the CAS program
            responded flexibly in assisting the Philippine Government to
            address its development challenges, but issues that plagued
            the implementation of the economic program in the late 1990s
            continued to hamper implementation of the FY02 CAS program.
            This Review recommends that the assistance program
            strengthen its focus on results and continue to concentrate
            on improving portfolio performance. Lending should be
            carefully calibrated with the implementation of reforms and
            against measurable outcome indicators. ",Country :  Philippines,Content Type : Reports,"January 1, 2005

Senegal - Primary Education Development Project and the Second Human Resources Development Project, Web Resource,"The outcomes of both projects were
            rated moderately satisfactory because project objectives
            were only partially achieved. The projects clearly had a
            significant impact on primary school enrollments in
            project-supported areas, and the increase clearly benefited
            the girls and the rural poor. Despite much staff training,
            however, the projects did not have the expected effect on
            improving the quality of education. One reason was that in
            both cases, few students benefited from textbooks. World
            Bank performance was rated satisfactory, while Borrower
            performance is rated unsatisfactory because the government
            showed limited political will to make the changes needed for
            achieving universal primary education. Some of the lessons
            confirmed by this project include: Sectoral adjustment
            programs that include policies which governments are
            reluctant to implement are likely to fail. To make needed
            policy changes, project designs shoud include dialogue,
            delineation of various special interests, and a process to
            understand how they are likely to interact. Where strong
            special interests exist in favor of higher education,
            conditionalities to reduce expenditures in it prove
            ineffective. A broad effort to increase primary scholl
            enrollments may result in the deterioration of educational
            quality. Pedagogical advisors and school-based management
            with well-trained principals empowered to take action might

"Indonesia - Fifth Population Project (Family Planning and Safe Motherhood), Yogyakarta Upland Area Development Project, and Village Infrastructure Project", Web Resource,"The audit finds that the Village
            Infrastructure Project and Part B of the Fifth Population
            Project were highly satisfactory, because each scored highly
            on relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. The Yogyakarta
            Upland Area Development Project is rated satisfactory: some
            doubts remain about its relevance but it measures up well
            against the criteria of efficacy and efficiency. Four
            lessons have been learned. 1) Village midwives are an
            efficient way to improve the general level of healthcare in
            villages: they are accepted by the authorities, work
            effectively with traditional birth attendants, and can
            partially support themselves from private fees. 2)
            Small-scale infrastructure projects cannot easily be
            targeted to the poorest individuals but if they are located
            in the poorest areas and villages they are nevertheless
            likely to have a significant impact on reducing poverty.
            However, care needs to be taken that the menu of options is
            fully presented to villagers and the selection process is
            truly demand-driven. 3) There is no case for making
            incentive payments to villagers who help build roads. 4) In
            Indonesia, working directly with village people rather than
            through local government has been shown to produce sound,
            sustainable results and is an approach worthy of
            replication. Building capacity at the village level may make
            villagers more able to guide development and to exert
            pressure on district and sub-district governments to be more
            responsive to their needs. ",Country :  Indonesia,Content Type : Reports,"December 29, 2000

            Program Project (CSDP II). The outcome of CSDP I was highly
            satisfactory -- except for the reforms to INFONAVIT
            (Instituto del Fondo Nacional del la Vivienda de los
            Trabajadores); all of the objectives were met. CSDP II,
            which built on the success of CSDP I, was rated less
            satisfactory. No further progress was made on reforming
            INFONAVIT, this has implications for the fiscal costs of
            reform: if required contributions to INFONAVIT have low
            returns, the government's guarantee of minimum levels
            of pension income may be called. Little progress was made on
            preparing the way for reform of the public pension system.
            Lessons learned from these two projects include: a) The pace
            of a series of single tranche adjustment operations can be
            tailored to suit the ability of the country to undertake
            them, rather than trying to predict what will become the
            most binding constraints. b) Pension reforms should expand
            its coverage to government workers and workers in the
            informal sector. This requires specific efforts for each
            group. c) Pension reform is a complex process and requires
            complementary financial sector reforms to be successful. d)
            Mexico is subject to a substantial country risk premium,
            which results in high real interest rates on domestic debt. ",Country :  Mexico,Content Type : Reports,"October 23, 2000

Nepal - Avian Influenza Control Project, Web Resource ,"This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Nepal Avian Influenza Control Project under the Global Program for Avian Influenza. Following global concerns and outbreaks of avian influenza in India in 2006, the World Bank responded to requests from the Government of Nepal to assist in increasing capacity to respond to avian influenza and a potential influenza pandemic.  
The overall project outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Building on the project experience, this PPAR identifies several lessons: i) Investments in laboratory equipment and civil works may be inefficient if they outstrip the financial and technical capacity of staff to operate and maintain them; ii) Failure to adjust compensation rates for inflation and other price increases can reduce the real value of compensation payments, reducing incentives for farmers to report disease outbreaks; iii) Attempts to control spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) among poultry at the border may have limited effectiveness in countries with long, porous borders; iv) Containing an influenza epidemic or pandemic among humans is likely to be extremely difficult in countries like Nepal with modest public health infrastructure; and iv) Collaboration with United Nations agencies can provide technical expertise that the World Bank lacks, but there can be delays in implementation if there is insufficient engagement of these agencies at a headquarters level.",Country :  Nepal,Content Type : Reports,"June 17, 2013

The Lesotho Hiahlands Water Proiect-Phase 1 B was a second investment phase of a large and still ongoing water development program to capture and transport surplus water from Lesotho to South Africa.The Community Development Support Project was a Learning and Innovation Loan was designed to pilot community-driven development approaches for financing village infrastructure targeted on poorer communities.
IEG's evaluation shows that LHWP- 1 B had a moderately satisfactory outcome overall. The project's objectives were substantially relevant, given that additional revenues for poverty reduction were a clear need.
The project's design was also relevant. Providing the physical and managerial infrastructure for water exports would provide royalties that could be used for poverty alleviation. IEG evaluated CDSP' s outcome as unsatisfactory. The highly unsatisfactory performance of the project's community development program was partly compensated by satisfactory performance of the national poverty monitoring component. Risk to development outcome is significant because, although national poverty monitoring is continuing and is supported by Government (only a moderate risk), the community-driven development program supporting the project's primary objective failed, manifesting its high risk.",Country :  Lesotho,Content Type : Reports,"May 4, 2010

            Government's 2004 PRSP, which were to: (i) strengthen
            competitiveness; (ii) accelerate human development; and
            (iii) improve governance and public sector management.
            Between FY05-FY08, the Bank provided US$41.7 million for
            seven projects, of which US$13.1 million was provided from
            various trust funds, and was supported by fifteen analytical
            and advisory studies and five capacity building grants. The
            overall outcome of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is
            rated as moderately unsatisfactory. Progress towards meeting
            the CAS objectives in the fiscal consolidation and economic
            competitiveness pillar was assessed as moderately
            unsatisfactory. The growth upturn had little effect on
            unemployment and poverty levels. Little progress was
            registered in fostering fiscal and structural reforms to
            improve competitiveness or create fiscal space for priority
            social sector outlays. Fiscal deficits exceeded targets,
            public debt levels remained high, and new external arrears
            were incurred in 2007 and 2008. IDA assistance made a
            valuable contribution to improving the road link to Ethiopia
            and mobilizing foreign investment support for the port
            although the objective of improving the railway system was
            not met. The outcomes of the human resource development and
            poverty reduction pillar were assessed as moderately
            satisfactory. Solid progress was registered in repairing
            damage from the 2004 flood, responding to the 2007 food
            crisis, improving access to basic schooling and health care,
            combating the spread of HIVIAIDS and delivering
            community-driven urban poverty reduction programs. Still,
            Little progress has been made in improving the efficiency
            and effectiveness of social services, or establishing a
            well-targeted social safety net. IEG rates the outcomes of
            the governance and public sector management pillar as
            moderately unsatisfactory. With IDA analytic and capacity
            building support, some progress has been made in improving
            budget processes, but internal controls and accountability
            institutions remain weak, and there is little public
            scrutiny of the budget and its execution. Moreover, an
            improved procurement system has not been established and the
            management of the Customs service remains unchanged. The
            Bank's performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
            The Bank's strategy overestimated the political support
            for structural reform and the program was not designed to
            assist in the challenging fiscal and structural reforms. The
            reform momentum that ushered in the CAS was lost when policy
            dialogue temporarily lapsed. Although high-case lending
            triggers were not met, and lending support for fiscal
            consolidation and competitiveness reform was not provided, a
            high-case level of assistance was ultimately delivered due
            to exceptional assistance support provided for emergency
            response support and additional education assistance. ",Country :  Djibouti,Content Type : Reports,"April 13, 2009

Turkey - Country partnership strategy : Country assistance strategy completion report - IEG review, Web Resource,"This review examines the
            implementation of the FY04-06 CAS and evaluates the FY07
            CASCR. The CAS sought to support activities that sustained
            and deepened Turkey~^!!^s 2001 reform program and helped the
            country prepare for its prospective negotiations for EU
            accession. Under the CAS, Bank assistance was provided to
            further four objectives: 1) sound Macroeconomics and
            Governance; 2) equitable Human and Social Development; 3)
            attractive Business Climate and Knowledge; and 4) strong
            Environmental Management and Disaster Prevention. Under
            objective 1, Turkey achieved high rates of growth with
            lowered inflation; this review rates the outcomes of the
            Bank~^!!^s support under this objective as satisfactory.
            Under objective 2, rapid growth appears to have led to
            significant poverty reduction from 27 percent with incomes
            of less than US$2 a day in 2002 to 20.5 percent in 2005. In
            addition, there was important progress in social indicators.
            Gender balance also improved over the period, this review
            rates the outcomes under this objective as highly
            satisfactory. Under objective 3, the most significant
            outcomes relating to increased FDI and exports were
            substantially over-achieved. The attribution of these to the
            Bank~^!!^s programs is somewhat more tenuous than under 1
            and 2 above but there is evidence that the presence of the
            Bank and its continued willingness to provide assistance
            through the Development Policy Loans and Export lending
            provided reassurance to both domestic and foreign investors,
            this review rates the outcomes under this objective as
            highly satisfactory. Under objective 4, while there was
            progress on both environmental management and disaster
            prevention, the pace was slower than the Bank had projected
            in the CAS. The Bank found it difficult to structure
            appropriate interventions faced with an apparent lack of
            commitment and interest on the part of the Turkish
            authorities. This review rates the outcomes under this

Evaluation Capacity: Who Needs It? , Web Resource,"Who needs evaluation capacity? Years ago the answer to this question would have been the donor community.  This situation has changed dramatically in the last couple of years. Many more countries are setting up evaluation offices as part of their own systems. They – from governments to citizens – want to know how well policies and programs work, whether funded by an external donor or government revenues.

This trend was evident at the Fourth Global Forum of the Regional Centers for Learning on Evaluation and Results (CLEAR) Initiative in Mexico City, where I had the privilege to meet and share ideas with leaders from around the world about their ambition to build evaluation into their systems for managing public sector service delivery, finance, and beyond. It is a demonstration that governments recognize the importance of evidence and greater understanding of development processes. With a capacity to evaluate, countries are able to make better informed decisions – including taking calculated risks – about the management of the public sector as a whole and public finance in particular. Evaluation contributes to increased ownership of development processes, responsible governance, and timely corrective action when policies, programs, or institutions do not perform at their best.

Country  ownership and  evaluation champions are essential for the process of developing evaluation capacity. These champions can be policy-makers who see the true value of evidence in the decision-making and evaluators as the interlocutors with policy and decision-makers in their countries. They will ensure that evaluation focuses on priority needs and that it is taken into account. Champions are also essential for engaging with the many agencies that aim to develop evaluation capacities identifying the bottlenecks and the additional needs for support. They are the drivers of networks where leaders of strong evaluation functions reach out to debate each other’s challenges and solutions, as well as include peers in countries that just started their journeys in the evaluation capacity world.

Developing capacity involves a diagnostic process that is driven by those local champions. They should be able to call on other leaders in a similar situation and in the evaluation community to help them identify capacity needs and determine gaps and ways to close them, just as took place at the South-South Roundtable in Johannesburg that brought together leaders  from Argentina. Benin, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Niger, South Africa and Zambia.

Their ownership is essential for creating a shared vision, clear goals and targets, and a monitored, adaptable implementation plan. Implementation will involve typical elements of training, expert advice, and other inputs, and increasingly dialogue among leaders to develop:


	the enabling environment, which both sets the policy or authorizing context and signals demand for evaluation,
	 
	the institutions, which require they understand their clients, develop services, methods systems, and the human, technical, and financial resources to deliver services, and
	 
	people, who need skills, knowledge, and networks to perform at their best.



In recent years the number of evaluation capacity development efforts has exploded. The good news: more attention, more resources. The challenge: generating more and better synergies between these efforts so that they collectively produce more than the parts can deliver individually. Groups like the Development Assistance Cooperation Evaluation Network of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  and  initiatives like CLEAR or EvalPartners rally diverse stakeholders around a common goal, which is a good start.

How else to support these efforts?

Fostering an enabling environment for evaluation can take place through dialogue among high-level decision makers and evaluators to increase awareness of and demand for evidence from evaluation. Building evaluation into public sector/finance management programs would give a strong impetus to an enabling environment that asks for and uses critical evaluation findings.

Developing institutions. Take project-related Monitoring and Evaluation units:  instead of developing these units as part of a project management structure, they could be used as a platform for developing institutional evaluation capacities as an integral part of the government’s public administration. These units, situated in line ministries, when networked with the national statistical offices would form part of an institutionalized system that generates monitoring and evaluation data for all government investments rather than projects, and feed information into the national statistic system. In addition,  it is important to integrate the evaluation data these institutions generate  into specific decision-making processes with a clear understanding how evaluation evidence can and should inform choices, and a strategy to ensure evaluation services provide necessary evidence. A network of institutions will ensure that the system overall is efficient and connected with national statistical services.

Building people’s skills and knowledge receives a lot of attention, albeit with short-term measures. To close the demand gap for highly qualified evaluators, a long-term solution lies in investing in tertiary education that incorporates evaluation in faculties such as public administration, both for those who will become policymakers and policy implementers and need to understand evaluation evidence and its use in policy making and implementation, as well as graduate programs for evaluators to equip them with the necessary skills to deliver high quality evaluations. Working with a group of leading universities in partner and client countries to create a network will also help in developing comparable curricula, professional standards, and eventual professionalization of  this young profession.

Nicaragua - Completion and learning review for country partnership framework for the period FY13-FY17 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"Nicaragua is a lower middle-income country with a GNI per capita of $2,050 in 2016. Nicaragua’s annual economic growth increased from 3.3 percent during the prior CPS period (2008-2012) to 4.9 percent during the CPS period under review (2013-17). Growth was sustained by an adequate macro and fiscal environment and responded to higher growth of the US economy, from 0.9 percent to 2.2 percent between the two CPS periods. Growth helped reduce poverty rates, from 42.5 percent in 2009 to 29.6 percent in 2014 and 24.9 percent in 2016. Better social conditions are reflected in Nicaragua’s Human Development Index, which improved from 0.636 in 2013 (ranked 132nd among 187 countries) to 0.645 in 2015 (ranked 124th among 188 countries). However, inequality (the GINI Index) increased, from 44.2 in 2009 to 46.6 in 2014. The poverty rate in rural areas (50.1 percent in 2014) remains higher than in urban areas (14.8 percent in 2014), and 45 percent of Nicaraguans are at risk of falling into poverty if hit by a shock.",Country :  Nicaragua,Content Type : Reports,"March 5, 2018

            mid-project, risks conflict over unresolved issues. Most of

"Vietnam - Three Cities Sanitation Project, Sanitation Management for Urban Areas Project", Web Resource ,"This is a Performance Assessment of two World Bank-supported activities to assist the urban sanitation and drainage sectors in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Three Cities Sanitation Project was the first Bank-financed urban sanitation project in Vietnam, although it complemented the 1997-2004 Vietnam Water Supply Project that had the same client cities, namely Haiphong City, Danang City, and Halong/Cam Pha City. Project objectives were to achieve: (i) better urban sanitation services; (ii) reduced pollution; (iii) reduced flooding; (iv) better solid waste management; and (v) financially viable local sanitation utilities. IEG rated the World Bank performance as moderately satisfactory with a design focused upon appropriate activities, active supervision, but weak M&E. Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory with strong government ownership of the project. Sanitation Management for Urban Areas (Economic and Sector Work) was prepared as a study as the Three Cities Sanitation Project was winding down in 2008. The results for this piece of economic and sector work were satisfactory. The study provided a baseline assessment of urban sanitation services, and also provided some suggestions on best practices for on-site sanitation. Particularly at the national level, it helped raise sector stakeholdersâ awareness of the challenges posed by the precarious baseline of urban sanitation infrastructure and services in the country. The study was also satisfactory in terms of its strategic relevance and ownership. The quality of the product was satisfactory.

Evaluation of World Bank Support for Public Sector Reform, PDF file,"The effectiveness and efficiency of a country's public sector is vital to the success of development activities, including those the World Bank supports. Sound financial management, an efficient civil service and administrative policy, efficient and fair collection of taxes, and transparent operations that are relatively free of corruption all contribute to good delivery of public services. The Bank has devoted an increasing share now about one-fifth?of its lending and advisory support to the reform of central governments, so it is important to understand what is working, what needs improvement, and what is missing. To address these questions, IEG has examined lending and other kinds of Bank support in 1999-2006 for public sector reform in four areas?public financial management, administrative and civil service, revenue administration, and anticorruption and transparency. Although a majority of countries that borrowed to support public sector reform experienced improved performance in some dimensions, there were shortcomings in important areas and in overall coordination. The frequency of improvement was higher among IBRD borrowers than among IDA borrowers. Performance usually improved for public financial management, tax administration, and transparency, but performance did not usually improve with respect to civil service. Direct measures to reduce corruption?such as anticorruption laws and commissions?rarely succeeded. Recommendations to the Bank focus on improving guidelines for civil service and anticorruption reforms and on setting realistic objectives and sequencing for reforms.", ,Content Type : Reports,"February 26, 2008

"Do Health Sector-Wide Approaches Achieve Results? Emerging Evidence and Lessons from Six Countries: Bangladesh, Ghana, Kyrgyz Republic, Malawi, Nepal, Tanzania", PDF file,"This study distills evidence from six countries (Bangladesh, Ghana, Kyrgyz Republic, Nepal, Malawi, and Tanzania) to address four questions regarding Sector-wide Approaches (SWAps) in the health sector:  (1) Were the anticipated benefits of the approach realized? (2) Were the objectives of the national health strategies and programs of work achieved? (3) Did the approach facilitate the achievement of national health objectives? (4) In what ways did channeling support through a SWAp affect the World Bank's efficacy?  
This paper draws on the findings of Project Performance Assessment Reports conducted by IEG on health SWAp support operations in Bangladesh, Ghana, and the Kyrgyz Republic, and of field-based case studies that assessed the Bank's lending and non-lending support to health, population, and nutrition in Malawi and Nepal. This paper also incorporates the findings of an evaluation of Tanzania's health SWAp, commissioned by the Government of Tanzania, and financed by development partners. This study draws on a review of Bank support for SWAps in itslending portfolio and it distills health SWAp experience to date.  It was undertaken as input to IEG's recent evaluation of the World Bank's support to health, nutrition, and population: ""Improving Effectiveness and Outcomes for the Poor in Health, Nutrition and Population: An Evaluation of World Bank Group Support since 1997."" The paucity of health SWAp evaluations in the literature, the richness and complexity of the preliminary findings, and the strong demand for more distillation of SWAp experiences and lessons all were justification for the undertaking of a more in-depth analysis.","Country :  Tanzania, Nepal, Malawi, Kyrgyz Republic, Bangladesh, Ghana",Content Type : Reports,"December 15, 2009

Lebanon - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) for the period FY2006-FY2009 : IEG review, Web Resource,"This review covers the Bank's
            FY06-FY09 strategy in Lebanon as defined originally by the
            four-year Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) issued on
            November 22, 2005 and revised by the Interim Strategy Note
            (ISN) issued on July 9, 2007 that covered the period through
            June 2009. The ISN reflected the Bank's response to the
            changes stemming from the hostilities with Israel in 2006
            and the political upheaval that has dominated Lebanon. While
            the broad lines of the strategy remained the same, as did
            the most of the results framework, the ISN brought into the
            picture the Government's reform program presented at
            the international donor conference convened in January 2007
            (Paris III). The ISN also did away with the staged lending
            scenarios of the CAS. The CAS and the ISN provided for Bank
            support under three pillars: (i) governance, economic
            management and growth support; (ii) development of human
            capital and mitigation of the poverty effects of transition;
            and (iii) natural resource and environmental management.
            This support was intended to help address Lebanon's
            severe macroeconomic imbalances, limited employment
            generating growth and deficient public infrastructure and
            services. Overall, progress was weak in achieving both the
            objectives laid out in strategy documents and
            reconstruction. Under the first pillar, progress was limited
            to some improvement in public debt indicators. Progress on
            the second pillar's objectives was limited to improved
            HIV monitoring arrangements supported by a Bank
            Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant. Progress on the
            third pillar was limited to better training for judges on
            environmental matters. Little if any progress was achieved
            on other outcomes under each pillar. However, the
            reconstruction efforts did succeed. These achievements

            CASCR are reviewed. IEG's 2009 Bangladesh Country

            assistance guided by the FY01 CAS, FY03 CAS Progress Report
            (CASPR) and the FY06 CAS currently under review. The CAE
            outcome rating for Bank assistance was moderately
            satisfactory, while as explained below, the outcome rating
            for Bank assistance during the CAS period FY06-09 is
            moderately unsatisfactory. There were three broad objectives
            in the FY06-09 CAS: (1) improving the investment climate,
            for which IEG judges the outcome of Bank support to be
            satisfactory; (2) empowering the poor, where the outcome is
            judged moderately unsatisfactory; and (3) the overarching
            objective of core governance, where the outcome is judged
            moderately unsatisfactory based in turn on modest
            achievement in both sub-objectives, improving public
            financial management (including procurement), and
            strengthening institutions of accountability including legal
            and judicial reform. One of the few quantitative CAS
            targets, increasing tax revenues by 1.5 percent of GDP, was
            not achieved, while some progress under the CTG in
            procurement reforms and strengthening the judiciary was
            recently reversed. Portfolio quality improved but remains
            slightly below South Asia Region and World Bank averages.
            Weak governance, including corruption, affected lending but
            the Bank, with a notable contribution from the Department of
            Institutional Integrity (INT), aggressively addressed
            problems and instituted better risk management. ",Country :  Bangladesh,Content Type : Reports,"June 24, 2010

            which evaluated the outcomes of the Bank~^!!^s assistance to
            Indonesia over the period FY99-FY06. The CAE found that
            during the review period the Bank had been able to restore
            its credibility in Indonesia, which had been eroded during
            the Asian financial crisis and its aftermath. The outcomes
            of Bank support to Indonesia were considered as moving in
            the right direction although progress was slower than
            projected in the CAS, and risks remained significant.
            Accordingly, the overall outcome of Bank assistance was
            rated as moderately satisfactory. The CAE was discussed at a
            CODE subcommittee meeting on January 23, 2008. The strategy
            was organized around three pillars: (i) improving the
            climate for high quality investment; (ii) making service
            delivery responsive to the needs of the poor; and (iii) the
            core issue of governance. These broad categories required
            large numbers of sub-categories. The Bank~^!!^s strategy was
            to support the strengthening of the investment climate and
            the improvement of basic service delivery, while addressing
            governance issues. During the CAS period Indonesia faced
            unprecedented natural disasters-including the Nias and
            Yogyakarta earthquakes and the Aceh tsunami of December
            2004. The Bank added disaster risk management as a fourth
            focuses area in the CAS progress report and the CAE

            promoting the financial viability of agricultural lending by
            increasing savings mobilization and boosting agricultural
            productivity and rural incomes through credit operations.
            Both projects became effective a few months behind schedule,
            the third project in June, 1981, and the fourth project in
            January, 1988. The third project experienced serious delays
            in disbursements and the closing date was extended four

            period and was also the first in the series to be disbursed

            with an inflation rate of around ten percent and a large
            depreciation of the Tunisian Dinar, entailed a ninety-one

            institutional development and available data suggest that

Afghanistan - First Agricultural Credit Project, Web Resource,"Ratings for the First Agricultural
            Credit Project for Afghanistan were as follows: government
            performance was unsatisfactorily, and Bank or International
            Development Association (IDA) performance was satisfactory.
            Some lessons learned included: although potentially sound
            from an economic viewpoint the minor irrigation
            rehabilitation (MIR) scheme was ahead of its time and
            involved some fundamental errors in preparation, design, and
            implementation; and, project objectives in terms of
            institution building should probably have concentrated on
            AgBank alone as the resources available to both IDA and
            Government of Afghanistan (GOA) were, in retrospect, not
            sufficient to make the necessary impact on the irrigation
            department of ministry of agriculture and irrigation (MAI).
            The full implications of water, and water rights (within
            this particular climatic setting), in a subsistence tribal
            society of fiercely independent people was not fully
            appreciated by all concerned (Afghan and expatriate) right
            from the outset of preparation, through appraisal and
            initial implementation. Given the now stronger institutional
            setting and improved credit framework, a better designed MIR
            type of development, with its significant quick-yielding
            benefits, should be reconsidered for inclusion in future
            AgBank lending operations. Within Afghanistan tractors
            appear to be a profitable and economic investment both for
            farmers and the nation. The insistence on using a
            locally-made untested implement, the polyculture, resulted
            in the manufacture of a product unacceptable to farmers. The
            revised charter and management of AgBank together with
            acceptance of mixed Expatriate-Afghan management must serve
            as a significant lesson to both IDA and GOA. The principle
            of Executive Board Management by which all seven members
            have equal voting rights and the President does not have
            overriding powers or a casting vote is unusual in
            Afghanistan and within the context of a successful
            institution should be carefully noted. ",Country :  Afghanistan,Content Type : Reports,"June 27, 1978

Tanzania - Program Loan Project, Web Resource,"This report concerns with the program
            loan made to Tanzania in December, 1974. Its principal
            objectives included the provision of quick disbursing
            assistance for Tanzania's investment program and to
            encourage the government to implement certain policy changes
            of a longer term nature. The main conclusion of the audit
            report is that the program loan achieved its immediate
            objective of providing additional resources to Tanzania at a
            time when the deterioration in its terms of trade, and the
            drought, had subjected the economy to considerable pressure.
            It thus contributed to the maintenance of investment and
            growth by providing foreign exchange for essential imports
            of capital equipment, intermediate goods and raw materials.
            The program loan also enabled the Government to mobilize
            other program assistance from bilateral sources. Its major
            effect was thus in adding to the total of available
            resource; it did not have any effect on the specific
            composition of imports, nor was it intended to. The
            arrangements regarding counterpart funds were implemented
            but, since they were relatively small by comparison to the
            development expenditure for which they were used, they had
            no practical effect on the distribution of such expenditure.
            The loan was made in support of agreed policies designed to
            overcome Tanzania's balance of payments problem in the
            medium term, particularly by directing public investment
            towards the directly productive sectors of the economy, and
            by taking measures to encourage agricultural production.
            These objectives and measures were expressed in somewhat
            general terms and hence the degree to which they have been
            implemented and the progress which has been made towards the
            achievement of their announced objectives are not subject to
            precise assessment. The full results of the policies agreed
            upon in connection with the program loan will only become
            apparent in the longer run, and much will depend on the
            extent and consistency with which they can be carried
            through over the next few years. ",Country :  Tanzania,Content Type : Reports,"December 1, 1976

            functioning of the overall cooperatives program during

            problems of the overall program can be divided into eight
            related categories: (1 ) technical difficulties, caused
            mainly by the complexity and size of the 1,000 ha UCPs; (2)
            shortage of competent management for the UCPs; (3)

Poland - Completion and learning review for the period FY14-FY17 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"Poland is a high-income country (HIC) with a GNI per capita of $12,680 in 2016. Poland’s annual economic growth accelerated to 3.3 percent during the CPS period (2014-2016) from 2.9 percent over the previous four years, 2010-13. The consistency of the country’s macro and structural policies has been the key driver behind the economy’s growth and helped its transition to HIC status in less than 15 years. Poland’s economic growth has been inclusive in the past decade, as evidenced by growing employment and earnings for all income groups, which led to a substantial reduction in poverty and stronger-than-average growth of the bottom 40 percent of the distribution. Between 2005 and 2014, Poland’s Gini coefficient fell from 0.351 to 0.343. The poverty rate measured at $5.00/day 2005 PPP stood at 4.4 percent in 2015. Poland’s strong economic growth is expected to continue in the near term; however, the longer- term prospects could be subdued by demographic and structural challenges – including a rapidly aging population, slowdown in total factor productivity, infrastructure gaps, low domestic private investment and regional disparities -- if left unaddressed.",Country :  Poland,Content Type : Reports,"May 23, 2018

This eview covers the join program of the World Bank and the International Finance Corproation (IFC). 

The broad objective of the CPS was to provide Guatemala with demand-driven and focused assistance to achieve key development goals, which include reducing poverty and inequality by expanding opportunities for the poor, particularly the most vulnerable, via sustainable and broad- based growth. 

IEG rates the overall outcome of the Guatemala CPS as Moderately satisfactory, the same as the CPSCRâs self-rating. IEG concurs with the lessons drawn in the CPSCR, which are grounded in WBGâs implementation experience in Guatemala. The most important of these is the need for realism in the assessment of the prospects for results, with a much sharper focus on the degree of ownership of various stakeholders and the effects this is likely to have on prospects for policy reform and institutional development.",Country :  Guatemala,Content Type : Reports,"September 18, 2012

The efficacy of the project in terms of achieving enrollment expansion and improved  learning is substantial.  World Bank performance is rated satisfactory and Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The risk to development outcome is moderate.
The outcome of the Secondary Education Development Program project is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The objectives are substantially relevant although relevance of design is modest. Efficacy of the project in terms of achieving objectives is modest.

Sri Lanka - Country assistance strategy FY03-FY07 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The FY03-06 Country Assistance
            Strategy (CAS) was developed at a time of great optimism.
            After nearly two decades of civil conflict, a cease-fire
            between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the
            Government of Sri Lanka was in effect and peace negotiations
            were underway; a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) had
            been approved and a private sector-oriented government was
            in power and implementing an economic reform program; and
            the country was experiencing a gradual recovery with annual
            economic growth of more than 5 percent. The FY03-06 CAS was
            anchored in Sri Lanka PRSP and its objective of reducing
            poverty through contributing to peace and promoting economic
            growth with equity were relevant. The assistance program was
            only partly consistent with the strategy since the PRSP had
            identified infrastructure deficiencies as the key
            determinant of the lack of growth and equity outside the
            Western Province, and infrastructure was largely excluded
            from the Bank's program. On December 26th 2004, Sri
            Lanka was struck by a tsunami that claimed over 60,000 lives
            and displaced close to one million people. The Bank
            responded quickly with a rapid needs assessment and two
            large emergency operations. The CAS was developed around 32
            outcomes for each of three pillars: peace, growth, and
            equity. In the face of diminishing support for economic
            reform, the CAS Progress Report (CASPR) narrowed the scope
            to 19 strategic outcomes, with several of the CAS objectives
            consolidated and those related to enterprise deregulation,
            educational pluralism, and tertiary education dropped. Also
            a fourth pillar, tsunami reconstruction, was added. In the
            revised program of support in the CASPR, the focus shifted
            from policy-based lending towards lending operations that:
            (i) support human development; (ii) further the recovery in
            conflict-affected areas; and (iii) assist road and

India - Social Safety Net Sector Adjustment Program, Web Resource,"This performance audit report rates
            the Social Safety Net Sector Adjustment Program for India.
            It was prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department
            (OED) following a mission visit to India in 1996 and is
            based in part on an Implementation Completion Report (ICR).
            The audit rates the project outcome as marginally
            satisfactory (the ICR rated it satisfactory), because its
            policy conditions were met and basic objectives were
            achieved. Project sustainability is rated as likely by both
            the audit and the ICR, since the Government of India
            demonstrated its capacity to maintain and increase real
            expenditures for selected social sector programs. The audit
            rates the project's contribution to institutional
            development as negligible (the ICR rated it modest), since
            the operation did little to modify institutional
            arrangements in the social sectors. Borrower performance is
            rated as satisfactory by both the audit and the ICR, since
            the Government of India did meet the conditions of tranche
            release. The audit rates Bank performance as unsatisfactory
            (the ICR rated it satisfactory), because the project missed
            an important opportunity to promote qualitative changes in
            social safety net programs or to ease institutional
            constraints on program efficiency and effectiveness. Three
            lessons learned are as follows. First, apparent
            opportunities for major adjustment efforts, such as those
            present at the identification stage, must be balanced with a
            realistic assessment of the constraints to sectorial
            performance. Second, the failure of the Social Safety Net
            project to demonstrate changes in the effectiveness of
            safety net programs, and only marginal influence on the
            fiscal budget, suggests a need for greater rigor in the
            selection of conditions and the development of more explicit
            links between sectorial and macroeconomic policy dialogue.
            Third, for policy-based lending in the social sectors to be
            effective, it must be embedded in horizontal arrangements
            that support information sharing and ownership across agencies. ",Country :  India,Content Type : Reports,"June 19, 1998

Addressing rural water supply gaps with performance-based financing: lessons from Vietnam , Web Resource,"The share of the world’s rural population with access to safely managed drinking water services reached 60% by 2020, but still lags behind a comparative rate of 85% among urban populations, according to the World Health Organization and the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund’s Joint Monitoring Programme. Bridging this gap by increasing rural access to improved and sustainable water supply and sanitation services is critical to developing human capital to unleash the growth potential of rural areas.

The World Bank’s synthesis report on the policy, institutions, and regulation (PIR) approach in the water and sanitation sector noted that financial incentives can be enhanced through performance-based financing (PBF) mechanisms and instruments, such as the World Bank’s Program for Results (PforR). Incentives can be enhanced through the use of performance-based contracts with the private sector, which involves payment to contractors being directly linked to the delivery of timely and quality results. This model was recently used in Vietnam, as part of the first operation for the country and the World Bank’s Water Global Practice to adopt the PforR financial instrument to improve rural access to water and sanitation services. An evaluation of the results and performance of the operation by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) identifies a number of lessons to guide the future use of performance-based financing in both the water and sanitation, and other sectors.

Vietnam has had an impressive record of inclusive economic growth since 1980s, but poverty has remained concentrated in rural areas and among ethnic minorities. Although rural access to water and sanitation improved along with economic growth, challenges remained regarding the sustainability of the initiatives that provide water services and hygiene. To address those sectoral challenges, in 2011 the government of Vietnam updated the National Target Programs (NTPs) for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation to strengthen community participation, demand-responsive approaches, and cost recovery. The World Bank has been supporting Vietnam’s rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) sector for more than 20 years and launched the Results-Based Rural Water Supply and Sanitation under the National Target Program (RWSS PforR), introducing a results-based approach in fund allocations and disbursements.

What Worked, and Why 

The PforR was a good instrument for addressing the dominance of and collusion among state-owned enterprises in contract procurement and management. The RWSS PforR promoted competitive bidding to enhance transparency and accountability in public agencies’ procurement processes. The results-based financing approach addressed the frequent delays in water scheme constructions. The PforR promoted results-based financing and independent results verification, which led to: (i) transferring risk associated with construction delays to service providers and contractors to motivate them to deliver results quickly and cost-effectively; (ii) incentivizing implementing agencies to select target areas based on criteria including the households’ willingness to pay for water connections; and (iii) making the contractors accountable for ensuring quality, transparency, and accountability throughout the construction process.

The PforR also contributed to diversifying financing for rural water service delivery by promoting private sector–led service delivery models. Before the RWSS PforR, the rural water systems were seen as scattered and difficult to manage with a low potential for profit, and consequently private investment in most of the eight participating provinces was also low. The World Bank used the PforR to try to encourage the provincial governments to acknowledge that financing from, and relationships with, the private sector were fundamental to provincial investments. The involvement of private enterprises contributed to increased revenues and higher staff productivity, which led to improved cost recovery ratios for water supply schemes The privately managed schemes in rural areas of Vietnam had higher profits that averaged 35% of overall revenues, compared with 20% or less for other types of service providers. This was in line with the overall trend of an increase in private sector investments in the RWSS sector. Public-private partnerships in water and sanitation increased from $88.9 million in 2016 to $159.14 million in 2019. Moreover, privately managed water schemes had higher staff productivity. On average, one worker in a private enterprise distributed 3,850 cubic meters of water supply monthly, compared with 970 cubic meters for staff in community- or public-led service provision.

What Didn’t Work, and Why

In results-based operations, the drive to achieve the disbursement-linked indicator (DLI) targets could result in prioritizing communities that are relatively more advanced and already have lower poverty rates at program start-up. Provincial governments prioritized communes already on the way to meeting targets, rather than those with the greatest need. To ensure receipt of fund disbursements, the operations may focus on producing tangible results as early as possible, thus incentivizing the assignment of a lower priority to more complex activities. However, the latter, more complex activities may be critical to the broader development of borrower systems and capacities and to longer-term goals of inclusion of minorities and poverty reduction. Evidence suggests that the communes with the 50 lowest poverty rates were more likely to be selected rather than the communes with the 50 highest poverty rates. The same trend is evident in the prioritization and grouping of selected communes for implementation sequencing.

There was also a misalignment of the disbursement schedules between the government system and the RWSS PforR which caused frictions in financial management. The contractor of the water supply schemes bore the cash deficiencies in the annual budgets of the PforR in the participating provinces, per the contract provision. The daily recording of the expenditures related to the PforR posed another challenge. During IEG’s interviews, respondents pointed out that the PforR could have benefited from stronger political buy-in of the central ministries with responsibilities for budget planning and allocation; that is, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning and Investment.

Lessons 

The IEG’s evaluation suggests the following lessons:


	PforR design needs to be closely aligned with national policies and regulations, particularly regarding financial management. To avoid friction and imbalances in financial management, the design of PforRs needs to ensure that cash deficiencies do not occur in the provincial and subnational annual budgets because of differences among the disbursement schedules of the government system and the PforR operation. An exacerbating factor is that the Vietnamese budgeting and transfer system did not have a mechanism for adaptable performance-based transfers from the central government to provinces to enable results-based budget allocations. In 2020, the government of Vietnam also issued a decree (No. 56/2020/ND-CP) that specified that official development assistance and concessional loans be used to finance only capital expenditures and not recurrent expenditures, which prevented the development of a new PforR operation.
	PforR design and implementation need to exercise equity and inclusivity in targeting beneficiaries to avoid selection bias against hard-to-reach ethnic and the poorest minorities and to reduce their vulnerability in the long term. Concrete measures need to be adopted to ensure that results-based operations provide implementing agencies with incentives to work in challenging areas by inlcuding, for example, the integration of poverty alleviation as a DLI target.
	The existence of an enabling environment for private participation could enhance the effectiveness of PforRs. The results-based approach fosters the mobilization of private actors. The national policies and regulations promoted public-private partnerships, which were reflected in the design of the RWSS PforR. PforRs need to assess and harness opportunities to allow private enterprises to lead improvements in cost recovery ratios of water supply schemes. The experience with the RWSS PforR shows that Vietnam’s favorable enabling environment for private sector participation has enhanced the operation’s implementation effectiveness by improving the financial and operational sustainability of the country’s RWSS sector.


These lessons emerging from IEG’s evaluation can help guide World Bank support to institutions as they implement reforms and unlock the full potential of the private sector. Stay tuned for an overall assessment of the new financing instrument which will be presented through an overarching report that consolidates the findings of a cluster of Project Performance Assessment Reports on the Program-for-Results.

"Liberia: World Bank Group Country Program
Evaluation 2004 – 2011(Approach Paper)", Web Resource ,"Founded in 1821 by former American slaves, Liberia is today
a representative democracy, with a multi-party system, an elected president and 15 counties under unitary central government. Against a backdrop of longstanding resentment among indigenous groups against the ruling elites - primarily descendants of African American settlers - food riots in 1979 and subsequent unrest culminated in a coup d'Ã©tat a year later. Today Liberia is at peace, but still fragile, with isolated hostilities and a large number of refugees from Cote d'Ivoire. Following an absence of 20 years, the World Bank Group (WBG) returned to Liberia in 2003. It has since played a crucial role in assisting Liberia's reconstruction and development efforts, serving as one of the key development partners.Throughout the post-conflict period, the WBG has attempted to help Liberia achieve its societal goals through technical and financial support.
The main objective of this evaluation is to learn from the experience in
Liberia and to draw lessons for improving the effectiveness of future assistance - both in Liberia and in other fragile states. To this end, it will review the outcomes of WBG interventions, including lending,  non-lending services, debt relief and partners' harmonization
and alignment. The methodology will be applied holistically - with understanding, flexibility and a primary intent to learn. The evaluation will take into account Liberia's circumstances, including the initial conditions of a fractured society, destruction of institutions and the

Global Program Review: The Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF), PDF file,"The Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF) is a global partnership housed in Conservation International (CI) between CI, the World Bank, the Global Environment Facility, the MacArthur Foundation, the Government of Japan, and the French Development Agency that provides grants to NGOs and other private sector partners to protect critical ecosystems (ecological hotspots) in developing countries. During its first phase (December 2000 to June 2007), CEPF awarded approximately 1,000 grants to more than 600 NGOs, community groups, and private sector organizations in 33 countries. Averaging $16-17 million a year, CEPF grants have supported the expansion and enhanced management of protected areas, the promotion of alternative sustainable livelihoods in production landscapes, and environmental education, awareness and capacity building. An external evaluation conducted during the fall of 2005, found that CEPF had made strong progress during its first five years. However, there was some variation in the performance of individual hotspots, and the scope of the evaluation was limited by a lack of assessment of individual grant outcomes. As of March 2007, CEPF had contributed to the creation or expansion of 9.4 million hectares of protected areas in 15 countries, and CEPF activities in protected area buffer zones and production landscapes were, for the most part, achieving their environmental objectives. However, there is to need to better understand how these interventions are affecting the livelihoods of the people living in these areas.

This is the first CPS for Solomon Islands following an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) in 2010. Solomon Islands is a small, remote archipelago in the South Pacific, with a population of 599,419 in 2016. It is a lower-middle-income country with a GNI per capita of US$1,880 in 2016. Between 2013 and 2016, its economy grew at an annual average rate of 2.8 percent while population grew at an annual average rate of 2.1 percent. Economic growth has been driven mostly by logging, services, and agriculture. Solomon is classified as a Fragile and Conflict-Affected State (FCS). The poverty head count ratio using the national poverty line was 12.7 percent in 2013, with a quarter of the population living below US$1.90 a day (2011 PPP). The last estimate for the Gini index was 37 in 2013 (a decline from 46 in 2005).

Serbia - Country partnership strategy completion and learning review for the period FY2012-15 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"By the start of the CPS period, in late 2011, Serbia had lost some of the gains in economic stability
and poverty reduction which it had achieved in the period 2000-2008. Poverty increased since 2009,
especially in the rural areas, and the fiscal accounts showed large deficits and a growing public debt.
To grow faster, Serbia needed to put its fiscal accounts in order and reform its social spending
programs, particularly pensions, and the state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector. The inefficiencies of
SOEs and social programs dragged productivity down and made the economy less competitive. Serbia
also faced serious environmental problems, inherited from past policies that neglected the
environment. The CPS sought to address these problems through three areas: Focus Area I,
Strengthening Competitiveness; Focus Area II, Improving Efficiency and Effectiveness of Social
Spending, and a cross-cutting theme, and Focus Area III, Environmental Sustainability.
IEG rates the overall outcome of the WBG program in Serbia as Moderately Satisfactory.

            Strategy (CAS) as implemented until the present, and
            evaluates the CAS Completion Report (CASCR). The strategy
            was a joint between IBRD and IFC and this review covers both
            IBRD and IFC activities. This is one of the first reviews of
            a CASCR where the Bank's program was primarily
            analytical work, as opposed to lending. More of these types
            of CASCR are likely to follow. In this case, IEG contacted
            the authorities to get feedback on the AAA and drew on
            previous IEG evaluations of the WBG support to Thailand,
            including the country case study done for, the World
            Bank's support to Middle Income Countries: An

            national development agenda was drawn up around four
            pillars, human and social capital, competitiveness, poverty
            and inequality, and natural resources and environment,
            together with a cross-cutting fifth pillar in governance.
            With the focus on knowledge-sharing, IBRD supported all five
            pillars primarily through the CDPs. All AAA proposed in the
            CAS through FY05 materialized, and the diagnostic and
            knowledge-building work was in fact much more extensive than
            planned. The CASCR lists 31 documents published during
            2003-07, and 87 reports produced under the CDPs; there were
            also numerous workshops and continuous policy dialogue. IFC
            largely delivered on short-term objectives, but intentions
            in health, education, agribusiness and SMEs did not
            materialize. IFC's approach has evolved over the period
            in search for a role and working formula for engagement. Its
            presence in the country declined significantly. The CASCR
            derives good lessons from the implementation of the
            knowledge-based strategy. They include the need for
            top-level government commitment, the importance of results
            measurement for evaluation, and the need to better adapt the
            knowledge which the WBG brings to the local environment,

Addressing the ‘Infodemic’ to cope with the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic, Web Resource,"In addition to tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and professionals responsible for monitoring the progress of policies and evaluating their impact face a phenomenon that has particularly intensified in this crisis: that of an infodemic — a flood of information, some accurate and some not. As governments and average citizens face difficult decisions in the trade-off between protecting public health while preserving the economy and livelihoods, this flood of information makes it hard to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they are needed the most.

To help address this challenge, Clear Lusophone Africa and Brazil (LAB) officially launched the Monitor de Evidências Covid-19 (COVID-19 Evidence Monitor) during gLocal Evaluation Week 2020 that wrapped up earlier this month. Our aim is to provide our partners in government and the evaluation community, along with the various segments of society in the countries where we work, with a source of reliable information to support evidence-based decision making.

Misinformation can lead to a great deal of harm, and many organizations, such as the UN, are now officially fighting it. On the brighter side, however, knowledge-production and information-sharing has skyrocketed. Technology giants have signed the Open COVID Pledge, making their intellectual property available free-of-charge under open license. Major scientific publications such as Elsevier and Springer have given free access to research related to the new coronavirus. Many relevant magazines and newspaper globally have also taken down their paywalls for their pandemic coverage - a decision that has often led to new subscribers.

The  main role of the Monitor de Evidências Covid-19 is to help our audience navigate the infodemic associated with the new coronavirus crisis by curating  qualified, relevant, and evidence-based content from around the world about various topics, such as the economy, labor market, social policy, education, health, and early childhood, among others. The next step is to organize this data-gathering from multilateral bodies, governments, think tanks, and academic institutions into an online repository and make it available to our audience — public leaders, policy makers, academics, students, and so on, in Lusophone Africa and Brazil — through our social media channels and a brand new weekly newsletter, which is now available for subscriptions.

For the next few months, the Monitor de Evidências Covid-19 will also add regular reviews of the evidence-based, curated content to the online repository. All communications products provided by the Monitor will be delivered in Portuguese, making it easier for our community to access quality knowledge and use it in their everyday work in the policy arena. 

By focusing our efforts on filtering trustworthy sources and information, we expect to provide reliable guidance to professionals and the public at large seeking evidence to make decisions in these uncertain times of the COVID-19 pandemic and contribute to make them less susceptible to the toxic aspects of the infodemic phenomenon. This initiative is also part of the  commitments and efforts of the CLEAR global network to promote the planning and implementation of evidence-based public policies. It is an assertive way of strengthening systems and capacities for monitoring and evaluation, which will be a key element to produce the most effective and efficient responses to the new challenges posed by the current crisis.

Preserving rangelands for people and climate: Lessons from Mongolia, Web Resource,"In Mongolia, the word “rangeland” is synonymous with “homeland.” It is a clue to the importance of rangelands in a country where a quarter of Mongolians are herders, and the wider livestock economy provides sustenance, income, and wealth to nearly half of the population. For many nomadic societies herding is at the core of their life. Around the world, rangelands support the livelihoods, social traditions, and resilience of 500 million people, primarily in low-income countries. Yet the rangelands that these communities rely on for their livelihoods face a combined threat of overexploitation and climate change.

The quickening pace of rangeland degradation in Mongolia is driven by increased livestock numbers and reduced livestock mobility. In a 2018 report, 12% of Mongolian rangelands were heavily degraded and potentially irreversibly damaged, and another 16% would take up to 10 years and significant effort to recover. This continuing trend has been exacerbated by erratic weather patterns associated with climate change. This includes the increasing frequency and duration of extreme events like drought, floods, wildfires and dzuds (severe winter weather disasters that can lead to catastrophic livestock mortality), that are harming both rangelands and herder livelihoods. This dual threat is impacting rangelands around the world, especially in drylands, where most rangelands occur, and where 73% are degraded.


Evolution of livestock sector in Mongolia

Following liberalization in the 1990s, the livestock sector in Mongolia witnessed a dramatic increase of the national herd size and a change in herd composition in favor of goats (for cashmere). This was coupled with an increasing concentration of livestock in areas close to markets and services, and a decrease in nomadic practices and animal mobility. These changes have also included increased out-of-season grazing, trespassing on reserved pastures, and an associated rise in local conflict.


 

IEG recently conducted an assessment of World Bank support for natural resources management, such as rangelands, to assess the impact of these programs on the vulnerabilities of the millions of resource-dependent people. In addition to supporting livelihoods, rangelands have a vital role to play in mitigating climate change as they are natural carbon sinks, sequestering substantial amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the form of soil organic carbon. In drylands, the soils already store more than one third of the world’s soil carbon, with even higher potential under improved management.

While evaluating the World Bank’s support for addressing the natural resource management and vulnerability nexus, IEG conducted an extensive field assessment in Mongolia. The following lessons emerged from this experience that can help inform future investments in rangelands:

1. Solutions need to be best fit for the local context to ensure sustainable and equitable outcomes

Rangelands are often common pool resources: accessible to everybody, policed by nobody. A common approach to addressing the degradation of common pool resources is to give people individual ownership to increase their incentive to not overexploit the resource. Enclosures (i.e., fencing land and assigning individual plots) were used by the World Bank in Inner Mongolia, China, but this practice had unintended outcomes. In some cases, it increased degradation as restricted herder movement caused continued overgrazing in already overexploited pastures. It also increased inequality as powerful herders managed to claim the best land when it was divided.

This approach fundamentally changed local nomadic culture while yielding disappointing productivity and restoration benefits because it was not aligned with local socio-ecological conditions. In Mongolia, the World Bank instead appropriately used Community-Based Rangeland Management (CBRM). CBRM supports local agreement on livestock mobility and storage-related practices, including seasonal pasture rotation that allows for rest and recovery without fencing. The approach is rooted in adaptive strategies that are traditionally used by Mongolian herders to prepare for and respond to pasture and climatic conditions.

2. Governments need to establish an incentive structure that addresses the drivers of degradation and encourages ecologically responsible behavior

The governance of natural resources such as rangelands remains a challenge globally. In Mongolia there is little governance of the rangelands: there is no institution responsible for pasture management, and implementation of the existing land law is weak. Additionally, until very recently, there was no taxation of the livestock sector, and thus no disincentives against overexploitation. In the absence of incentives for sustainable management of open access rangelands and disincentives against overexploitation, herders are driven to ever-increasing herds to meet their consumption needs.


Extensive interviews in Mongolia found that most herders are aware of pasture degradation, including their own part in it, but they feel the current system leaves them no choice in this tragedy of the commons. They expressed support for a grazing fee or livestock tax, which would incentivize all herders to favor the common good over individual short-term self-interest. Strong institutions at the central and local level, complemented with appropriate governance measures, are crucial to create the incentive structures that help herders make decisions that support healthy rangelands and their own long-term self-interest.

Since July 2021, the Government of Mongolia has implemented a tax on livestock ownership, the revenue of which should be directed to rangeland and livestock management activities. Although a noteworthy development, successfully implementing and enforcing this law will require substantial political will and local governance capacity. As of now, it is too early to tell whether it will prove effective in incentivizing smaller herds and facilitating rangeland recovery.

3. Markets must be reshaped to put a premium on quality over quantity to support both rangeland health and improved livelihoods

In developing countries, and especially among nomadic herders, livestock supply chains are fraught with technical challenges in meeting basic quality, animal health, and sanitation standards. In Mongolia, as elsewhere, this undermines market access, including export potential. Specifically, the livestock sector suffers from unpredictable trade policies when China closes its border to Mongolian livestock products for fear of livestock diseases.

Without access to markets that place a premium on quality, demand is lacking for the high-quality or sustainably produced livestock products that could incentivize better livestock management and smaller herds. This in turn traps poor herder households in a low investment, low productivity, and low-income cycle. Therefore, value chain approaches that address market access, trade facilitation, livestock extension services, and price-quality relationships, are a key part of protecting rangelands and improving livelihoods.


Rangelands are currently neglected in the growing global restoration agenda, yet they are a major store of carbon and offer great possibilities for achieving both environment and development goals. By addressing the local incentive structures, markets and socio-cultural practices through the use of best fit solutions, which are also adapted to local socio-ecological conditions, rangeland regeneration and the protection of local livelihoods can go hand-in-hand to achieve development, biodiversity and climate outcomes.

Central African Republic - Emergency Food Crisis Response and Agriculture Re-launch Project, Web Resource ,"This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on the World Bank Emergency Food Crises and Agriculture Re-launch project designed to provide emergency assistance to vulnerable populations in the Central African Republic following a coup d’état in 2013. Because of the extent of the crisis, and the loss of government capacity in the wake of the crisis to implement emergency aid, the project was executed by the World Food Program (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), contracted by the Ministry of Rural Development.

Ratings for the Emergency Food Crisis Response and Agriculture Re-Launch Project are as follows: Outcome is unsatisfactory, Risk to development outcome is high, Bank performance is unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance is unsatisfactory. Lessons from the project include: (i) Standard Agreements between World Bank clients and UN executing agencies can facilitate success if they include a common vision about intended objectives, a clear and achievable results framework and related outcome indicators, and a clear articulation of how risks to the environment and social framework will be monitored, reported on, and managed. (ii) Efficient seed procurement for conflict-affected countries is complex owing to disruption of trading networks and normal supply and demand signals: the recruitment and funding of a technical team needs to be a prior condition of project effectiveness. (iii) Emergency food security operations do not necessarily require food agency coupling (such as WFP and FAO). (iv) Post-conflict emergency assistance in highly agrarian economies should try to maximize synergies across sectoral operations to optimize the delivery of food aid while laying a foundation for growth of the agricultural sector.

Pakistan: First and Second Programmatic Fiscally Sustainable and Inclusive Growth  Development Policy Credit (PPAR), PDF file,"This Project Performance Assessment Report evaluates a programmatic series of two development policy operations for Pakistan. The series was the World Bank’s first policy-based operation in Pakistan in more than a decade. The project development objective was to (a) foster private and financial sector development to bolster economic growth, and (b) mobilize revenue while expanding fiscal space to priority social needs”. The objective was matched by two policy areas. The first policy area covered reforming trade tariffs, privatizing state-owned enterprises, improving business registration, developing the microinsurance sector, and improving the availability of credit information. The second policy area covered improving revenue performance and enhancing the social safety net program.

Ratings for the First and Second Programmatic Fiscally Sustainable and Inclusive Growth  Development Policy Credits are as follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was high, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Quality of M&E was modest. This PPAR offers the following lessons: (i) In Pakistan, the World Bank reengagement with development policy lending after a long break benefited from a longer-term strategy (or program) that provides for several interrelated DPCs, a large and relevant technical assistance program, and close cooperation with the IMF. (ii) Dividing important sectoral issues among separate operations could be an effective strategy when the government is facing multiple reform challenges. (iii) Political economy analysis and communication support related to politically sensitive reforms were insufficient.

During its third phase (2004â08), CGAP pursued five strategic priorities: (a) promoting institutional diversity, (b) promoting diverse financial services to a broad range of clients, (c) building financial market infrastructure, (d) fostering sound policy and legal frameworks, and (e) improving the effectiveness of microfinanceÃÂ funding. Its activities focused on providing advisory services, developing and setting standards, advancing knowledge, and training and capacity building. An external evaluation, conductedÃÂ in 2006â07, concluded that CGAP is a powerful and pivotal force in the microfinanceÃÂ field, playing a critical role in helping to build inclusive financial systems. IEG's Global Program Review (GPR) also found that CGAP has strong relevance and effective governance. CGAP's achievements in terms of activities and outputs were also impressive during 2004â08, but there is little systematic evidence relating to its achievements at the outcome level, or their attribution to CGAP's activities due to weaknesses in its monitoring and reporting system.

Guyana - Completion and learning review for the period FY09-15 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"Guyana is a lower-middle-income economy, classified as IDA-only for WBG lending. Its per capita GDP-about US$4 thousand estimated in 2014 at market prices-is the lowest in the English-speaking Caribbean and total public sector debt, though low by Caribbean standards, remains above 60 percent of GDP after significant debt reduction in 2006-07. Forty three percent of the population lives below the poverty line, and roughly two thirds of the poor-29 percent of the total population-live in extreme poverty, with an expenditure level below that required to purchase a minimum low-cost diet. The majority of Guyana's poor live in rural areas, while extreme poverty is concentrated in the interior regions, away from coastal areas. The economy largely depends on the export of six commodities-sugar, gold, bauxite, shrimp, timber, and rice-which represent nearly 60 percent of the country's GDP and are highly susceptible to adverse weather conditions and fluctuations in commodity prices. The two main political parties share a pragmatic and centrist stance but their support is decided by ethnic loyalties rather than policy, which can lead to deep ethnic division and political instability. The economic context for this Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was one of solid growth-based on agriculture and extractive industries-with low and stable inflation. The main longer term challenges are related to reducing poverty, improving health and education, modernizing the state, and protecting an environment prone to natural disasters.

Algeria - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2004-10 : IEG review, Web Resource,"This review covers the Bank
            Group's FY2004-10 strategy in Algeria as defined
            originally by the three-year country assistance strategy
            (CAS) issued in June 30, 2003 and revised by the CAS
            progress report (PR) issued on July 27, 2005. Both
            strategies were joint between the Bank and International
            Finance Corporation (IFC), and reviewed. The assistance
            strategy addressed the challenges of using oil and gas
            reserves to benefit the Algerian population, fostering
            non-oil growth and employment, and improving public service
            delivery. The Bank support to address these challenges
            focused on three pillars: (i) strengthening fiscal
            sustainability, oil revenue management, and government
            effectiveness; (ii) removing the constraints to private
            sector-led growth, improving the business environment, and
            infrastructure development; and (iii) articulating and
            implementing a strategy for better service delivery,
            particularly for water supply, housing, environmental
            services (municipal waste management), and human development
            to meet the critical needs of its population. IFC sought to
            complement the Bank's support through financial sector
            development, small and medium enterprise (SME) support, and
            promoting private investments in cement and steel. The World
            Bank Group (WBG) accomplished a number of specific
            achievements, but its impact on key objectives was
            considerably limited and independent evaluation group (IEG)
            rated the overall outcome of WBG's program as
            moderately unsatisfactory. IEG places additional emphasis on
            three points. First, as economic and sector work (ESW) and
            non-lending technical assistance (TA) will play a critical
            role in the new CAS, selecting topics where additional
            knowledge is likely to help the Government move should be a
            key consideration as the CAS applies its principles of
            responsiveness, coherence, and selectivity on prospective
            fee-based services. Second, implementation of the new CAS
            will benefit from better monitoring of the intended
            objectives and expected outcomes. Third, IFC should consider
            expanding support to non-oil real sector investments,
            particularly in labor-intensive industries, including
            through SMEs linkages, given the acute unemployment problems

Tanzania - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) for the period FY2001-FY2003 : IEG review, Web Resource,"This review examines the
            implementation of the FY01-03 CAS and evaluates the FY07
            CASCR. The implementation of the FY0I-03 CAS was extended de
            facto through FY06, and the review covers the period
            FY01-06. This review rates the outcome of the implementation
            of the FY0I-06 CAS as satisfactory. Under priority (I), Bank
            support to the Government achieved its objectives of
            strengthening growth. Real GDP growth has averaged 6.9
            percent since 2001, against a background of low and stable
            inflation. The overall fiscal balance was broadly consistent
            with the projections in the CAS and IMF programs (the PRGFI
            and PRGF2). A cautionary note is warranted with respect to
            the large expansion of government expenditure and the
            sustainability of the resulting fiscal deficit (increasing
            from 5.6 percent of GDP in 2001 to 11.6 percent of GDP in
            2005), although the expansion had been matched by donor
            support on favorable terms, which did not appear at risk. In
            addition, while poverty may be declining in Tanzania on
            account of high growth, in the rural areas, where the
            majority of Tanzanians live, the pace of growth in
            agriculture is lagging. Also, while doing business in
            Tanzania remained difficult, problems with administrative
            barriers and poor infrastructure are being addressed,
            although progress has been slower than anticipated. Under
            priority (II), the outcome of Bank interventions that sought
            to build the asset base of the poor and reduce vulnerability
            had generally favorable outcomes, albeit with important
            caveats. The CASCR considers benchmarks for Bank assistance
            to Tanzania in health and education to have been partially
            achieved (and this review agrees). In education, very
            substantial progress was made in primary enrollment,
            although the success in this area has also led to an
            increase in the pupil/teacher ratio, raising the risk that
            learning outcomes will not keep pace. In health and water
            supply, access and sustainability appears to have improved,
            although not as much as initially envisioned, especially in
            HlV/AlDS prevention. In light of the progress made in
            achieving the benchmarks in the CAS results matrix, this

Peru - Fiscal Management and Competitiveness Programmatic Development Policy Loans Project, Web Resource,"This PPAR evaluates the programmatic
            series of Peru FMCDPL I–IV and supplemental financing to
            FMCDPL II. The FMCDPL series aimed to support the
            government’s reform program to improve the functioning of
            Peru’s public sector institutions and business environment.
            The support program rested on two pillars: (i) improve the
            efficiency and quality of fiscal management and (ii) enhance
            competitiveness. Under these, the FMCDPL program supported
            nine specific policy objectives: Efficiency and quality of
            fiscal management: (i) increase sustainability and
            transparency of fiscal policy, (ii) make tax system more
            neutral and stable, (iii) strengthen budget reporting and
            planning, (iv) increase equity in intergovernmental
            transfers, and (v) improve efficiency and impact of public
            spending. Competitiveness: (vi) make public sector processes
            more transparent, accessible, and agile; (vii) expand and
            deepen international trade; (viii) reduce transaction costs
            for the private sector to enter, operate in, and exit
            markets; and (ix) promote sustainable financial deepening.
            The overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory,
            reflecting substantial relevance of the objectives and the
            design and partial achievement of most objectives under the
            two pillars. Key lessons include: (i) When strong ownership
            of the client is demonstrated, a programmatic series of
            operations can offer the World Bank and its client win-win
            solutions. (ii) For the World Bank, a multiyear program of
            support gives it a chance to pursue an extended and coherent
            analytical agenda that may not be feasible in multiple
            one-off operations. (iii) To the client, the programmatic
            series offers a real-time opportunity to learn about the
            reforms (including both the costs and benefits) and to build
            on the momentum of initial success. (iv) In the case of
            Peru, despite all the positive steps the government has
            taken to enhance efficiency in the allocation of fiscal
            resources, a pressing need to rationalize the fiduciary and
            regulatory norms and the multiplicity of control and
            auditing instances remains. (v) The application of the DDO
            in this context to the second loan and its supplement
            illustrated the World Bank’s willingness and ability to
            support Peru at a time of considerable market uncertainty

Russian Federation - The First and Second Rehabilitation Loan Projects and the First and Second Structural Adjustment Loan Projects, Web Resource,"Given that the objectives of the
            First Rehabilitation Loan Project were only partially
            achieved, OED rates its outcome as moderately satisfactory
            and its institutional development (ID) impact as modest.
            With regard to the Second Rehabilitation Loan Project, while
            all the required policy reforms were completed prior to
            Board presentation, these reforms were insufficient to
            forestall further declines in output. Furthermore, the
            monetary stabilization program was never underpinned by
            adequate fiscal discipline. Therefore, OED rates the project
            outcome as moderately unsatisfactory and the ID impact as
            negligible. For both rehabilitation loans, sustainability is
            rated as likely, and Bank performances are rated as
            satisfactory. Borrower performance for the First
            Rehabilitation Loan was satisfactory, and unsatisfactory for
            the Second Rehabilitation loan. For both Structural
            Adjustment Loan Projects, OED rates the outcome as
            unsatisfactory and ID impact as modest, but sustainability
            of the limited achievements are considered as likely. Both
            Bank and Borrower performances are evaluated as
            unsatisfactory for both SALs. Several important lessons may
            be drawn from these projects. First, sound macroeconomic
            management is a pre-requisite for the positive responses
            expected to flow from structural reform, under all
            policy-based types of lending. Second, country ownership is
            crucial to the success of assistance. Third, in the face of
            a poor track record and narrow country ownership of reform,
            a large adjustment lending program (especially one with
            front-loaded disbursements) risk delaying rather than
            accelerating reform. Fourth, in the face of a poor track
            record and new consensus on a reform program, adjustment
            lending should be offered after the government has publicly
            adopted the necessary reforms or has begun implementing
            them. Disbursements should be backloaded and carefully
            modulated on the basis of solid progress in implementation,
            including enforcement of laws and regulations. Fifth, there
            needs to be strong strategic coordination and integration of
            actors, instruments, and interventions supporting common
            objectives both within the country and the Bank and among
            external development partners. Sixth, the Bank should not
            ignore in its adjustment lending the quality of public
            institutions and governance. Finally, the Bank should keep
            ""windows of opportunity"" in perspective, as
            transition and development take time. ",Country :  Russian Federation,Content Type : Reports,"February 24, 2003

Sierra Leone - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) for the period FY2006-FY2009 : IEG review, Web Resource,"This review examines the

            Strategy (CAS) 2006-2009 as well as of its Progress Report
            (CPSPR), completed in 2008. It also assesses the Sierra
            Leone FY06-09 CAS Completion Report (CASCR). In support of
            post-conflict Sierra Leone's first Poverty Reduction
            Strategy Paper (PRSP), International Development
            Association, or IDA's strategy had three pillars: (i)
            achieving good governance, security and peace; (ii)
            promoting pro-poor sustainable economic growth for food
            security and job creation; and (iii) enhancing human
            development. These objectives were highly relevant for a
            country emerging from ten years of civil strife. The
            objectives were strongly owned by a wide range of
            stakeholders who recognized the importance of restoring the
            rule of law, reconstructing infrastructure, reviving the
            economy, creating jobs and providing basic social services
            throughout the country. Bank support for sustainable growth,
            food security and job creation yielded a moderately
            unsatisfactory overall outcome. Despite recent results in
            advancing private sector development Sierra Leone still
            remains a difficult environment for private investors in
            obtaining construction permits and registering property.
            Sustained efforts by IDA and most development partners
            produced limited improvements in the legal framework and
            management of the mining sector. Power sector continues to
            constrain development, limit wellbeing of the population and
            pose huge reputational risks to IDA and the donor community.
            The results associated with Bank support for the attainment
            of human development objectives have been mixed, with a
            moderately unsatisfactory overall outcome. Good results in
            expanding education and health coverage were qualified by
            shortcomings in the quality of education, the poor results
            in health outcomes and the slow progress in improving the
            lives of the rural poor and the most vulnerable groups. At
            the end of this CAS period Sierra Leone still sits close to
            the bottom of the UN human development index. In rating the
            overall outcome, IEG gives more weight to areas with greater
            prominence in the IDA program, namely, transparency and
            accountability of public financial management, creation of
            jobs through private sector development, improved mining
            sector governance and advancement of human development.

Cape Verde - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2005-08 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The Bank's assistance strategy
            was aligned with Cape Verde's Growth and Poverty
            Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP) of 2004 and provided
            support to achieve its objectives through three programmatic
            loans and five investment projects amounting to US$64
            million and substantial complementary analytical and
            advisory services. The CAS's objectives were expressed
            in three pillars: (i) maintain macroeconomic stability and
            sound public finance; (ii) improve the investment climate
            and economic competitiveness; and (iii) implement social
            programs to alleviate poverty and inequity. Under Pillar I:
            Cape Verde's economic growth and macroeconomic
            performance exceeded targets by a wide margin. Its level of
            public debt is considered sustainable. The government passed
            laws, implemented systems and enhanced capacity to
            strengthen fiscal transparency and empower oversight
            institutions. A Medium Term Economic Framework (MTEF) was
            initiated, but the process of decentralization to
            municipalities did not make progress. The outcome for Pillar
            I is rated as satisfactory. Under Pillar II: Privatization
            as a mechanism to improve economic competitiveness and the
            investment climate was not completed. Although surveys
            suggest that the investment climate has deteriorated, high
            non-government investment and increased employment indicate
            that recent measures are ameliorating the situation.
            Economic regulatory agencies have recently become
            functional. The public-private partnership in
            telecommunication is successful, but in energy and water
            less so. Limited progress occurred in the transport sector
            and significant issues remain in infrastructure
            competitiveness, especially in energy and water. No progress
            was made in rural sector or environmentally sustainable
            growth. IEG rates of the outcome of Pillar II as moderately
            unsatisfactory. Under Pillar Ill. Education and health
            services' performance indicators improved appreciably
            and the social protection system's rationalization
            process was initiated. Services to vulnerable groups were
            improved. The poverty level was reduced, exceeding the CAS
            target. The outcome for this pillar is rated as
            satisfactory. Cape Verde improved its fiscal and
            macroeconomic management and achieved high economic and
            employment growth, resulting in a significant reduction in
            poverty and improvements in social services and protection.
            But little progress was made in many aspects of improving
            the investment climate and private sector development.
            Weighing achievements under each pillar equally, IEG rates
            the overall outcome as moderately satisfactory. The
            Bank's contribution to this outcome is rated as satisfactory. ", ,Content Type : Reports,"April 10, 2009

Colombia - Country assistance strategy FY03-FY07 : IEG review, Web Resource,"This review covers the FY03 Country
            Assistance Strategy (CAS) and FY06 CAS progress report. The
            CAS was prepared in anticipation of a new administration
            coming into office in 2002 and ahead of the new
            administration~^!!^s National Development Plan (NDP), which
            was issued about half a year after the CAS was approved. At
            the time, the economy was still reeling from the end-1990s
            economic crisis and the decades-old conflict that had been
            exacerbated by the breakdown in governance during those
            crisis years. At about 2 percent in 2002, economic growth
            was still below the steady average of 4.5 percent per year
            in the preceding decades and GDP per capita below the 1994
            level. The new administration laid out a strategy based on
            four objectives: (a) improve safety and security, (b) spur
            sustainable growth and generate employment, (c) improve
            social equity, and (d) strengthen State~^!!^s transparency
            and efficiency. The 2002 CAS and the 2005 progress report
            aimed at supporting economic development as a necessary,
            albeit not sufficient, condition for peace. The CAS was
            structured around three pillars: (i) attaining fast and
            sustainable economic growth, (ii) sharing the fruits of
            growth, and (iii) improving governance. The progress report
            maintained the original objectives of the 2002 CAS, expanded
            the scope of the first pillar to the area of competitiveness
            and added a fourth pillar on building the foundations for
            peace. Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) rates the overall
            outcome of the Bank~^!!^s assistance relative to plans in

            Progress towards the objectives of the second pillar was
            rated moderately satisfactory. IEG rates progress toward the
            objectives of the other three pillars as moderately
            unsatisfactory because of concerns regarding public
            expenditure rigidities. Also, improvements in
            infrastructure, the biggest lending component, had a limited
            contribution in stimulating growth and the contribution to
            improving agriculture competitiveness as a basis for
            reviving rural economy was negligible. IEG sees merit in the
            flexibility with which a lending program is adjusted in
            light of changing conditions. At the same time,
            accountability calls for building such flexibility into the
            CAS. IEG rates the Bank~^!!^s performance as moderately
            satisfactory taking into consideration such flexibility, as

IEG rates project outcome as satisfactory. Although by loan closing Romania's accession to the European Union had eased access to investment funds, thereby reducing the need for a line-of-credit project, overall, the project's objectives were substantially relevant. The project substantially achieved its objectives, particularly with respect to institutional strengthening.Risk to the project's development outcome is rated significant.

IEG rated the overall project outcome of the National Social Action Project as satisfactory and the risk to development outcome as moderate. The Food Crisis Grant's outcome was rated as  moderately satisfactory. Its objectives met an emergency need; and feeding services were substantially maintained. However, it only modestly achieved its objective to mitigate the impact of food price increases on consumer welfare, in part due to deficiencies in the relevance of design.

Annual Review of Development Effectiveness 2008: Shared Global Challenges, PDF file,"Reducing poverty in any individual country is increasingly intertwined with making progress on shared global challenges, fostering global public goods (GPGs) such as climate protection and communicable disease control. This year's ARDE tracks Bank performance in Part I and examines the Bank's work in fostering GPGs in Part II. Development outcomes from Bank lending have improved over the medium term. But in FY07 over-optimism in the Bank's ongoing assessment of project performance rose sharply, while the share of projects rated moderately satisfactory or better dropped to 76 percent from 83 percent a year earlier. Vigilance is needed to identify problem projects in real-time and ensure that the FY07 drop in performance does not foreshadow a persistent decline. Practical steps can be taken to better use M&E in projects and programs, including proper baseline information and clearer links between outputs and outcomes. The Bank's country-based model has worked relatively well in fostering global public goods when national and global interests dovetail and grants support country investments. But the greatest challenges, such as climate change, arise where local, national and global benefits--actual or perceived--diverge significantly. Here the country model comes under considerable strain. To more effectively bridge the gap between global needs and country concerns, the Bank should consider: creating dedicated budgets and better incentives for country teams to work on GPGs; better deploying its global knowledge networks; and more powerfully using its standing to give greater voice to developing countries in the governance of global programs.", ,Content Type : Reports,"September 1, 2008

IEG notes that, on balance, more of the CAS objectives were missed than achieved and were too general to provide an adequate structure for the design of the strategy. Implementation of the CAS program was adversely affected by political turmoil that led to a temporary suspension of operations and by severe food crises. The changed realities brought into starker relief the absence of a CAS Progress Report, which would have been useful for updating the strategy to guide the successful pursuit of CAS objectives. 

IEG concurs with the CASCR conclusion that when dealing with a country prone to frequent shocks, it is important to maintain a high level of flexibility in order to respond rapidly to crisis, while keeping the emphasis on the reforms required for reducing vulnerability to these shocks over the medium term. However, IEG disagrees with the CASCR conclusion that in fragile, under-aided states the World Bank should pursue a strategy of comprehensive engagement and a presence in all sectors where there are urgent reform and/or investment needs.",Country :  Niger,Content Type : Reports,"April 16, 2013

            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: The Bank's
            expectations on pricing policies were not achieved because
            of a fundamentally different Algerian Government perspective
            on the role of Societe Nationale de l'Electricite et du
            Gaz (SONELGAZ). Pricing has played no role in allocating
            resources for these programs and goals; and benefits, if
            any, are measured only at the far end of the production
            process. The institutional objective setting for public
            utilities projects financed by the Bank should be carried
            out with a more realistic appreciation of the political and
            social framework, especially in centrally planned economies
            where the concept of autonomous and financial viable
            utilities is not readily understood or accepted. ",Country :  Algeria,Content Type : Reports,"June 29, 1984

Timor-Leste - Completion and Learning Review : IEG Review, Web Resource ,"This review of the Timor-Leste’s Completion and Learning Review (CLR) of the World Bank Group’s (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covers the original CPS period (FY13-FY17), and the Performance and Learning Review (PLR) of 2016. The PLR extended the original CPS period by one year to FY18 in order to synchronize the CPS strategy with the country’s political cycle. Timor-Leste is a lower middle-income country, with an oil dependent economy. With oil reserves running low, the key challenges facing Timor-Leste are to achieve greater economic diversification and diminish reliance on public sector spending. At the beginning of the CPS period,
the political environment was stable and oil prices high. The country was affected by a significant fall in oil prices that started in 2013, and political uncertainty adversely affected economic activity in 2017 and for most of 2018, as public expenditures fell by over one third. On the whole, growth was modest compared to East-Asia Pacific region peers, reflecting both the fall in oil prices and the political uncertainty towards the end of the program period.

El Salvador - Income Support and Employability Project, Web Resource ,"This is a Project Performance Assessment Report of the Income Support and Employability Project (P117440) in El Salvador. The project development objective was to (i) provide temporary income support to the urban vulnerable poor, (ii) improve the coverage of labor intermediation and training services to the urban vulnerable poor, and (iii) improve the institutional capacity of the borrower to develop an integrated social protection system. The project was approved in November 2009 (fiscal year [FY]10) with an original closing date envisioned for December 2014 (FY15). The project underwent five restructurings throughout implementation. The final closing date was August 2016 (FY17). At appraisal, project cost was estimated at $50 million and government counterpart funding was $4 million. By project closing, $49.3 million of the loan proceeds were disbursed.
Ratings for the Income Support and Employability Project are as follows: Outcome was satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons from this project include: (i) A crisis period can create opportunities for broader reform of an existing social protection system through projects that adequately balance short and long-term objectives. (ii) Ensuring high participation and higher incomes for vulnerable groups requires interventions that are specifically tailored to address the needs of these groups. (iii) In an emergency context, a project can be implemented rapidly and effectively by using the country’s existing capacity when the project relies on an implementing agency with a proven track record and is accompanied by close World Bank supervision. (iv) The support of knowledgeable local actors is critical for the successful implementation of an intervention in areas affected by high levels of crime and violence.

"Evaluation of the World Bank Group's Development Effectiveness in Peru, FY03-09", PDF file,"This evaluation will assess the WBG's development effectiveness in Peru from fiscal 2003 through fiscal 2009. Since 2003 Peru has seen sustained economic growth that has put it on the verge of becoming an upper-middle-income country. Yet,  nearly 40 percent of its people continue to live in poverty. The Bank had 37 projects in Peru worth $3.4 billion during the review period; these included support for economic growth, improved service delivery, and strengthened public institutions. IFC had 56 investments worth $1.1 billion during the period; it aimed to support private sector growth and placed an increasing emphasis on social and environmental issues in the mining sector, deepening the financial sector, infrastructure development, and potential investments in a number of other sectors. MIGA had nine guarantee projects during the period for a gross exposure of $322 million; it sought to catalyze foreign investment in Peru's main productive sectors and to promote economic diversification.  The evaluation will review the relevance, efficacy, efficiency, and additionality of the WBG's development interventions and the organizational factors contributing to its effectiveness in Peru. It will address the questions through three levels of analysis: overall country level, sector-wide level, and project level.  It will provide an assessment of the WBG's overall effectiveness as well as distinct assessments for the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA.  The underlying theme of the evaluation will be based around the framework for growth and poverty reduction contained in the government strategies that the Bank supported. IEG will use a consultative approach, involving both WBG staff and stakeholders in Peru. It will also draw on existing IEG evaluations.

Liberia Country Program Evaluation: 2004-2011, PDF file,"This report evaluates the outcomes of World Bank Group support to Liberia from its postwar re-engagement in 2003 through 2011. Following re-engagement, the World Bank Group strategy in Liberia initially focused on two areas: (i) restoring the functionality of the state; and (ii) rebuilding infrastructure. The rebuilding of public institutions has seen substantial progress, with important achievements in restoring public finances and reforming the civil service. With respect to the rehabilitation of infrastructure, the World Bank Group has helped improve the conditions of roads, ports, power supply, and water and sanitation. As for facilitating growth, however, World Bank Group financial support has been relatively modest, but it has helped with policy advice and in filling gaps left by other partners. There were some effective programs carried out, including capacity development at several core public finance-related agencies. However, the integration of these themes across World Bank Group interventions, which was the underlying intent, still needs a vision and better articulated strategy. Finally, the Bank (together with the International Monetary Fund) led efforts to reduce Liberia's inherited external debt burden under the enhanced Highly-Indebted Poor Country Initiative and the Multi-lateral Debt Relief Initiative mechanisms. This was a crucial step in boosting the country's development efforts and normalizing aid flows. Although the evaluation is in broad agreement with the approach of the Liberia program, two issues merit greater attention. One is the stewardship of natural resources, including the need to systematically enhance the quality of governance across the value chain of resources-- with the overarching goal of sharing the benefits among all Liberians. The second issue is the need to create job opportunities, especially among youth.",Country :  Liberia,Content Type : Reports,"October 23, 2012

Croatia - Revenue Administration Modernization Project, Web Resource,"Ratings for the Revenue

            unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately
            unsatisfactory. This assessment offers the following
            lessons: (i) Poor quality at entry and lack of readiness for
            implementation contributed to significant implementation
            delays and limited results. (ii) Given that the main driver
            of the tax administration reforms was Croatia’s bid for
            membership of the EU, the project could have better secured
            the government’s commitment to reforms up front. (iii) In
            projects aiming to improve tax revenue administration, the
            right balance must be struck between institutional reform
            and hardware needs (buildings and information and
            communications technologies). (iv) High TTL turnover could

            Dividing important sectoral issues among separate operations
            could be an effective strategy when the government is facing
            multiple reform challenges. (iii) Political economy analysis

India - West Bengal Forestry Project, Web Resource,"The audit for the West Bengal
            Forestry Projects differs from the implementation completion
            report in that it finds the outcome of the project
            marginally satisfactory. This is due to the negative effects
            of the reorganization, the budget situation, and weak
            project design, which will be felt for a long time in the
            state and have been a setback for the Forestry Department.
            The audit draws several lessons from the project. Great
            caution is required when issues like reorganization are made
            part of project design. A sector wide project, can be more
            effective when coordination with the Government on certain
            issues is built into project design. A coordinated
            multi-sectoral approach can provide for increased
            effectiveness and better planning. The need to fulfill
            preset targets should not be allowed to dilute project
            goals. Finally, suitability of lending instrument has an
            important bearing on project outcome. ",Country :  India,Content Type : Reports,"June 25, 1999

Lebanon: Cultural Heritage and Urban Development Project (PPAR), PDF file,"
	
		
			
			Lebanon has a rich and diverse cultural patrimony inherited from many civilizations that existed in succession on its territory. But this heritage has been damaged by disasters and conflict, and more recently by the rapid and unmanaged growth of Lebanon’s historic cities. The World Bank partnered with the Government of Lebanon and bilateral agencies in 2003 to implement the Cultural Heritage and Urban Reconstruction Project (CHUD)-to help conserve and restore the country’s cultural patrimony in five of its historic cities – in Baalbek, Byblos, Saida, Tripoli and Tyre. CHUD’s objective was to create the conditions for increased local economic development and enhanced quality of life its historic centers and to improve the conservation and management of the country’s cultural heritage. The US$119 million project was financed with an IBRD loan,  parallel financing from the Governments of France and Italy, and with counterpart financing.

			Ratings for this project are as follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons from the project include: (i) Assigning economic values of cultural heritage requires consideration of both its “use” and “non-use” values. (ii) Urban rehabilitation projects designed to expand public space require ex-ante and intermittent analysis of the risks associated with local economic displacement, due to restricted access and the changing preferences of upgraded space. (iii) Infrastructure-led urban rehabilitation of economically dense and culturally sensitive urban cores requires complementary investments in “soft skills” to ensure effective two-way communication about project aspirations and to adapt to citizen concerns. (iv) Cultural heritage and sustainable tourism investments must be designed to respect residents’ needs and aspirations and to protect communities’ residential right from unintended consequences.

Poland - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2005-08 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The FY05 CPS supported Poland during
            the period immediately following Poland’s accession to EU
            membership and was geared to Poland’s overarching objective
            to reach two-thirds of EU average per capita income by 2013.
            Bank support was focused on helping Poland strengthen its
            public finances (fiscal consolidation), increase its
            competitiveness (competitiveness/convergence), and promote
            employment and social inclusion (employment, poverty, and
            equity). The CPS envisaged a flexible, partnership modus
            operandi for the Banks program, with evolution of the
            program driven by government demands and a set of principles
            of engagement in a rolling annual process. The outcomes
            targeted by the CPS were substantively relevant to Poland’s
            convergence objectives and the instruments/operations were
            appropriate and well-linked, in an explicit results
            framework, to intended outcomes of Bank assistance. However,
            some of the targeted sectoral reforms in sensitive sectors,
            while necessary given Poland’s income convergence
            objectives, may have been overly ambitious given the
            political environment and their daunting nature. Lending and
            non-lending deliveries were roughly as envisaged in the CPS.
            Portfolio quality, as gauged by project at risk indicators
            and evaluations of projects at closing, was generally
            moderately lower than Bank and ECA Region averages.
            Individual product AAA quality, as reflected in a QAG
            country AAA assessment covering two years of the CPS period
            and the Region’s assessment in the CPSCR, was satisfactory,
            but both QAG and the Region found that the deliveries, while
            demand driven, tended to be opportunistic and that the
            Bank’s program lacked strategic coherence and impact.
            Country outcomes during the CPS period, prior to the onset
            of the current global financial crisis and recession, were
            good, with strong growth of income and employment,
            underpinned by strong macroeconomic management. Outcomes
            with regard to the specific structural reforms intended to
            sustain growth at levels needed for rapid income convergence
            were, however, mixed. In general, at least some progress was
            made in most areas. Overall, the outcome of Bank support to
            Poland during this period is rated as Moderately
            Satisfactory. The Bank’s performance was also mixed. The CPS
            represented a sensible approach to post-EU accession
            engagement with Poland, and was developed with considerable
            client and partner input. Deliveries and product technical
            quality were generally consistent with Bank norms. However,
            in retrospect, the principles of engagement set forth in the
            CPS were not sufficient to ensure that the resultant program
            would be strategically coherent. The consequent ad hoc
            approach of the Bank came about primarily because of the
            absence of a major champion of reform on the government
            side, at least until recently, and hence was beyond the
            Bank‘s control. On balance, IEG rates Bank performance as
            moderately satisfactory. ",Country :  Poland,Content Type : Reports,"June 10, 2009

India - Country partnership strategy (CAS) completion report review for the period FY09-FY12 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the Fiscal Years (FY) 2009-2012 India Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the FY 2011 CAS Progress Report (CASPR), and assesses the CAS Completion Report (CASCR). The review covers the joint program of the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). 

The main objective of the CAS was to assist India to achieve the goals of the Eleventh Five Year Plan: a country free of poverty and exclusion. The CAS objectives were organized under three pillars: (i) achieving rapid, inclusive growth; (ii) ensuring development is sustainable; and, (iii) increasing the effectiveness of service delivery. A cross-cutting focus was to achieve effective public spending and results. In response to the Governmentâs request, the CAS committed to focus on the low-income states.

IEG rates the overall outcome of WBG support as moderately satisfactory, below the CASCR rating of satisfactory. The CAS program pursued a broad range of objectives that were ambitious and included areas where engagement was nascent. While good progress was achieved on multiple fronts, there was slow and partial progress in some important areas. 

IEG concurs with the lessons drawn by the CASCR. However, it wishes to underscore that the lack of a well-specified results chain linking the WBG interventions with CAS objectives, and weak M&E in program implementation seriously constrains the learning process.",Country :  India,Content Type : Reports,"March 28, 2013

            had qualified after a satisfactory three-year track record

Bangladesh - Third Fisheries Project, Web Resource,"The audit of the Third Fisheries

            satisfactory on outcome, Bank, and Borrower performance;
            substantial on institutional development; and uncertain on
            sustainability. If not for the weaknesses in project design
            and the consequent need for the substantial cancellation,
            highly satisfactory ratings would have been considered. The
            project offers four main lessons. First, proactive
            supervision from a field office, along with technical input
            and donor coordination, can play a large role in achieving
            objectives. Second, it is possible to be successful in local
            community management of a large water body, provided there
            is local participation with NGOs, good technical input, and
            a strong government committment. Third, mechanisms for cost
            recovery and clarifiation of operation and maintenance
            responsibilities for structure should be resolved in advance
            of investments. Finally, although untested approaches

            as satisfactory, borrower performance as satisfactory,
            institutional development as high, sustainability as likely,
            and Bank performance as satisfactory. The lessons learned
            are as follows: In the project-related aspect, this project
            used a ""standard"" disbursement of seven years,
            equivalent to the execution period of the project. However,
            projects with a limited scope, being executed by a highly
            competent agency, should be designed with shorter execution
            periods. In the policy-related aspect, the unique
            capitalization approach to privatization attracted foreign
            capital that went into the coffers of the power companies
            and transferred administrative control to the private
            sector. The reform of Bolivia's power sector
            demonstrated that, to attract private capital, more
            important than the size of the sector or the relative
            development of the country is to have in place a clear
            regulatory system, strong and autonomous institutions to

Brazil - Sites and Services and Low Cost Housing Project, Web Resource,"The Third Highway Project in Pakistan
            was completed. Project implementation was troubled. Road
            rehabilitation suffered substantial delays, cost-overruns
            and large problems arising primarily from the inexperience
            and financial weakness of the domestic contractors.
            Implementation of the road maintenance component succeeded
            only in part, but the project planted a seed for maintenance
            improvements under the Fourth Highway Project. Actions to
            support the domestic construction industry fell short of the
            plan. In particular, during the stretched-out Implementation
            period, no periodic maintenance program for domestic
            contractors was realized. Flaws in project design and
            supervision suggest tightening of Bank project management

            should be considered where necessary. Second, the
            Government, Bank, and ADBP need to renew the effort to
            monitor the impact of mechanization ""on a continuous
            basis"", especially the social impact, rather than
            represent that there is no longer an issue. Lastly, being

            rates, wherever they occur in the lending chain, the Bank
            for some years has pressed for market interest rates. This

Argentina - Agricultural Credit Project, Web Resource,"Ratings for the Agricultural Credit
            Project for Argentina were as follows: financial performance
            was good, and institutional performance was good. Some
            lessons learned included: though the Bank was willing to
            amend the loan agreement so as to bring the on-lending terms
            under the project into line with the changing Argentine
            situation relative to inflation and interest rates, the
            Government of Argentina did not attempt to check out the
            demand for agricultural credit by publicizing the project
            and making it operational, but sought the cancellation of
            the Bank loan. To the extent that there was demand for
            credit to finance investment in agriculture, it was
            apparently met by the rollover of short-term credit, based
            more on bank-client relationships than on well-defined and
            technically evaluated on-farm development plans.
            Nevertheless, with the benefit of hindsight, it does seem
            that the Bank underestimated: (a) the impact of
            inflation-related uncertainties on farmers' investment
            decisions, and (b) the extent to which on-farm capital
            expenditures can be financed through rollover of short-term credit. ",Country :  Argentina,Content Type : Reports,"November 30, 1981

            role in the preparation of the project. The principal
            deficiencies of the project were in the area of institution

Vietnam : forest sector development project, Web Resource ,"The Forest Sector Development Project, which was implemented between 2004 and 2015, contributed to the significant reforestation efforts made by the people of Vietnam. In parallel to this smallholder plantation initiative, the project sought to protect biodiversity in parks and reserves. Bare hillsides underwent reforestation, and by 2017 the level of forest cover reached 48 percent (from 27 percent in 1990). The improved outlook for production forest was matched by an increased government commitment to conserve biodiversity in parks and reserves, which were legally designated as special-use forests. (SUF). The two project objectives were to achieve sustainable management of plantation forests and to conserve biodiversity in special-use forests. 

Ratings for the Forest Sector Development Project were as follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was modest, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons from the project include: (i) When located appropriately, smallholder forest plantations can boost economic growth in rural areas and help protect the environment—as long as smallholders have continuing access to a full package of technical and financial support. (ii) Smallholders with limited means tend to operate single-species tree plantations on a short rotation; it is too early to say if this trend will continue, or if it poses a long-term risk. (iii) Smallholders with limited means tend to operate single-species tree plantations. (iv) Attempts to engage communities in management of protected areas will only prosper if these areas (and their associated buffer zones) generate substantial revenues that are shared with the participating communities. (v) The design of World Bank projects should have achievable, incremental, and rigorous targets for sustainable forest management (national or international) within given timeframes with iterative steps toward recognized global standards.

Kyrgyz Republic : rural education project, Web Resource ,"General education in the Kyrgyz Republic comprises 11 grades, one less than in most developed countries. The system is robust in both enrollment rates and access from a gender equality perspective. The primary to lower secondary transition rate is universal, and the net enrollment rate in lower secondary is about 90 percent, and in higher secondary is about 72 percent. General education is taught in Kyrgyz or Russian in 90 percent of schools and in Uzbek in 9.4 percent of schools. Teaching is available in more than one language in about 25 percent of schools, often leading to parallel classes being taught in different languages within the same school, resulting in increased cost of education provision. Governance in the education sector was, and continues to be weak; the Ministry of Education and Science is nominally responsible for setting education policy and providing oversight in the education sector. However, aspects of the system operate largely independent of its oversight, leading to a disconnect between funding and policy execution with associated inefficiencies. 

The project development objective for the $15.00 million Rural Education Project was to assist in improving learning and learning conditions in primary and secondary schools, with priority attention to rural areas. Project ratings were as follows: outcome was moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons include (i) A selective, and realistic approach to design is likely to create a more closely articulated link (attribution) between World Bank interventions and outcomes. (ii) Relatively inexpensive but strategically positioned interventions can have a significant effect. (iii) Robust monitoring and evaluation is a fundamental component of project management and is integral to the articulation of, and sometimes to the realization of, desired outcome.

Some of these lessons are: 1) investments in highly technical environmental cleanup operations often face significant unknowns with respect to the nature and extent of the pollution problem and the available options for remedial actions; 2) a horizontal adaptable program loan may not add efficiencies in preparation or synergies in implementation if country circumstances are significantly different and if there is little opportunity for intercountry cooperation and coordination; 3) complex international partnership arrangements, such as those in the ASP-P1, can result in conflicts in defining roles and responsibilities, challenges in effective coordination, and confusion in project interventions.", ,Content Type : Reports,"September 29, 2016

Mauritius - Port Development and Environmental Protection Project, Web Resource ,"The outcome of the project is rated highly satisfactory; all four objectives were achieved in full and well within budget. Port productivity improved substantially and the cargo volume handled grew dramatically. This generated economic benefits and boosted transshipment operations for the port. Following the promulgation of a new Ports Act, the Mauritius Port Authority's role was redefined as the regulator and landlord of the port, and the Mauritius Freeport Authority was also strengthened. Sound environmental protection measures, such as safeguarding against marine pollution from oil spillages and ships' waste were also introduced in the port.  Institutional development is rated substantial, especially in view of the solid legislative and institutional reforms, accompanied by enhanced staffing skills and innovative participatory interaction with the trade unions and other stakeholders. The success of the project is in part also due to the excellence of the participatory approach and broad consultation process. There were substantial social implications arising from the new institutional framework with implications both for employment and conditions of service. Bringing in the trade union at an early stage helped to overcome potential misunderstandings and created a mutually supportive instead of a confrontational situation. Because of the large number of stakeholders the participative approach to the Master Study Plan and the creation of the Port Users' Council were very helpful and led to general agreement on the way forward. Sustainability is rated likely, rather than highly likely, since continued growth depends on further expansion and further urgent investment decisions if the momentum is to be maintained. Linked to this conclusion a further urgent and propitious course of action would be to bring in a second port operations company to introduce a more competitive situation to improve productivity further. The recent loss of the traffic of a major transshipment operator is a warning sign that the port needs to move quickly on these matters to elevate its performance to an even higher level in keeping with the demands of the market.",Country :  Mauritius,Content Type : Reports,"November 29, 2005

            associations to identify a private sector representative who
            can lead the dialogue on their behalf. (ii) Projects should
            include measures to ensure sustainability of support centers
            that provide capacity building to MSMEs after project
            closing. (iii) Design and implementation of credit

            standards. (iv) Integrating a rigorous impact assessment
            into the design of World Bank projects supporting MSMEs

            with this project confirms a number of OED lessons. First,

            also benefit from applying similar approaches. Second, the
            right combination of incentives can help staff retrenchment
            programs promote entrepreneurship, by helping outgoing staff
            establish small enterprises that use skills developed in the

            development than the OED evaluation summary, but lower than
            that of the implementation completion report, which rated

            while the project contributed to the speed and quality of

            complement to the policy dialogue, it did not adequately
            address several areas which later emerged as key constraints
            to the country's development. Three main lessons emerge
            from the project. 1) Given the high level of borrower
            commitment, this technical assistance (TA) loan was an
            effective way for the Bank to engage and stimulate reform.
            2) In a highly uncertain situation - the Bank in essence
            knew little about Armenia when the project was designed -
            flexibility is essential for a TA project. 3) An
            inexperienced borrower requires additional supervision. This
            was exemplified by the poor consultant performance and the
            instance in which government employees apparently worked

            government commitment, enhanced by the extension

            subproject preparation, and implementation. Lessons reflect
            on the superior performance of the NERDPP, partly due to the

            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First, a
            structural adjustment program can indeed be a catalyst to
            initiate changes in economic management behavior in an
            otherwise stagnant environment. Second, it is imperative to
            be absolutely clear on what technical assistance is supposed
            to accomplish. Third, if technical assistance is an integral
            part of the SAL program, the Bank should be the executing
            agency, even if the country insists on obtaining grant
            (non-Bank/IDA) financing for technical assistance. Fourth,
            the Nepal SAL I was overly ambitious in its coverage. Fifth,
            the SAL project showed the Government that the Nepalese
            economy can indeed be brought out of stagnation if
            appropriate policy changes are introduced. Finally, the
            project showed the Bank that a more focused approach can
            still yield tangible results. ",Country :  Nepal,Content Type : Reports,"June 20, 1991

Nepal - Third Water Supply and Sewerage Project, Web Resource,"The Third Water Supply and Sewerage
            Project for Nepal was a failure in light of the Bank's
            long involvement in the water supply sector in Nepal and the
            current state of the sector, particularly the current lack
            of secure long term water supplies in the Katmandu valley.
            The significantly increased distribution network has
            insufficient water to deliver. In terms of water quality,
            more people now receive worse service. Institutional
            improvements have been minimal and operation and maintenance
            are poor. The financial situation of the sector agency is
            little short of disastrous. The Bank has not distinguished
            itself under this project or through its previous
            involvement. There are many lessons to be learned from this
            project. First, inadequate project preparation can have a
            very high price. Targets must be matched to the real
            capacity of the sector agencies. Lastly, better analysis and
            more thoughtful programs are required when governments have
            strong reluctance to accept Bank prescriptions for financial
            improvements and consumers are resistant to pay for poor service. ",Country :  Nepal,Content Type : Reports,"November 30, 1990

            in contrast to the ICR satisfactory rating, though the audit
            upgrades sustainability as likely in contrast to the ES

            findings and lessons for the IDP included: Financial sector
            operations should be undertaken only in a conducive
            macroeconomic environment; for a project whose goal is to
            advance structural transformation of the enterprise sector,

            operation; the size of the line of credit was too large,

            business environment. For the PSAL, lessons included:
            Timing, and government commitment are critical to the

            substantial institutional development impacts. Regardless of
            success, lessons drawn from the project focus on three main
            findings: 1) The value of the project lies in that it
            focused on significant institutional, policy, and regulatory
            aspects required to improve the marketability, and
            competitiveness of Hungarian products. Specific action plans
            within both the private, and public sectors were critical
            contributions to the project, and, though intangible, the
            impact of this technical assistance surpassed the impact of
            the line of credit component (98 percent of project costs
            alone). The project played a catalytic role in the promotion
            of private investments, while strong government ownership,
            and solid project preparation helped raise the impact of the
            project. 2) Restrictions, contradictory to privatization
            goals, warrant the Bank to redefine policies regarding
            allocation of funds for financing used assets, particularly
            in the context of transition economies. 3) The Bank's
            reporting requirements, disbursement conditions, and
            procurement guidelines are perceived to reduce
            competitiveness in financing private sector investments;
            thus, an in-depth analysis of the expected benefits from

            modest. Although the project objectives were highly relevant
            to the country's development objectives for a
            transition to a market economy, by increasing agricultural
            productivity, and competitiveness, the limited political
            consensus for reform was conducive to an unsatisfactory
            performance by the Borrower, in spite of an overall
            satisfactory performance by the Bank, who established a
            coherent framework for policy reform, and a high quality
            sector work. Lessons suggest that, regardless of a high
            quality sector work, the Bank must broaden the range of
            partners, and stakeholders, so as to enhance the domestic
            ownership of reforms, and advance the reform agenda. This is
            reflected in the lack of a credible forum, where workable
            consensus could have been reached, suggesting that the
            process of policy, and institutional reform, is as important
            as the substance of the reforms, in achieving success.
            Furthermore, realistic changes in institutional legislation,
            regulations, and procedures are also required for reforms to
            become effective. And, in order to attract the private
            sector in supplying agricultural inputs, explicit measures
            need to demonstrate credibility, and commitment by the

Kazakhstan - Structural Adjustment Loan and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan Projects, Web Resource,"This report audits the Structural
            Adjustment Loan (SAL), and the Financial Sector Adjustment

            satisfactory, though the institutional development impact
            ratings differ, being only modest regarding the SAL, but
            substantial regarding the FSAL. Due to governance issues,
            the SAL audit reduced the rating of sustainability to
            uncertain, since the use of non-transparent processes
            adversely affected the emergence of competitive markets,
            and, the continued ownership of large firms by the state,
            casts doubt on the sustainability of some benefits expected
            from privatization. However, the FSAL sustainability is
            likely, given that the incentives underpinning the program
            should permit the continuation of a favorable environment.
            Lessons drawn from the SAL indicate that transparency in
            privatization is essential to the emergence of competitive
            markets, and, that closer supervision might have enabled
            timely resolution of the Investment Privatization
            Funds' problem, prior to the disappearance of funds.
            Regarding the FSAL, lessons suggest that strong political
            will is essential for reform implementation, and, that the
            power, and competence of the central bank, to enforce
            discipline, are key factors for successful financial reforms. ",Country :  Kazakhstan,Content Type : Reports,"June 7, 2000

            Development Association (IDA) and governments when sectoral
            agencies are faced with financing needs for investment
            projects. 1) Of critical importance for IDA is rigorous
            internal review to ensure that projects'
            quality-at-entry is not compromised. 2) Flexibility can be
            taken too far when IDA's standards of excellence in
            project identification, appraisal, and processing are
            compromised. 3) Borrowers considering external assistance
            need to be sure that sectoral projects are well prepared
            before approving their inclusion in the development budget.
            Without strong oversight, projects may temporarily fill gaps

            prepared and lead to sub-optimal investments for the
            country. 4) Community participation components require
            rigorous design, including analysis of community
            capabilities, communication mechanisms to encourage
            information flows, incentives and training to build

Botswana - First Family Health Project, Web Resource,"The First Family Health Project in

            this project as unsatisfactory, and the borrower performance

            and information system changes within MOH, and cost recovery
            systems were not introduced. A key lesson of the project is
            that it is important that the Bank's policy dialogue

            its primary objectives, including improving the

            continuous support and it is fundamental to adequately
            estimate the time and resources needed for full

            promoting more inclusive development as well as a
            cross-cutting theme of advancing mutually beneficial
            relations with the world. The CPS proposed to support

            cooperation and China's role as a global stakeholder.
            However, the cross-cutting theme is not reflected in the

Uganda - Sexually Transmitted Infections Project, Web Resource ,"Project ratings for the Uganda
            Sexually Transmitted Infections Project are as follows:
            Project outcome is moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability
            is likely; institutional development impact is substantial;
            Bank performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance
            is satisfactory. These are among the lessons cited from this
            project: 1) Political commitment is a strong catalyst for
            mounting a broad-based national response to the HIV/AIDS
            epidemic. It also influences program content. In this case,
            the government was sensitive to the convictions of religious
            groups and other facets of civil society, so that the
            promotion of condoms and support to marginalized high-risk
            groups received only modest support, and success was not
            fully realized. 2) Even if it is provided for in project
            design, monitoring and evaluation will not be carried out if
            the incentives are not right. The setting of appropriate
            targets requires knowledge of the right measures of success
            and baseline data. 3) The failure to implement research on
            the cost-effectiveness of various interventions is a missed

Ghana - Trade and Investment Gateway Project (GHATIG), Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews Bank experience for the Ghana Trade and Investment Gateway Project, effective from 1999 through December 2009 (with an original closing date of December 2005). The project objectives were to attract a critical mass of export-oriented investors to Ghana to accelerate export-led growth and to facilitate trade. 
This evaluation rates the project outcome as moderately satisfactory. The lack of flexibility in the original project design and the undue reliance on the performance of a single private developer are among the key factors that contributed to the limited success before restructuring. Legal challenges further protracted the process of the replacement of the private developer. Finally, following restructuring, the project successfully addressed the main constraints of on-site infrastructure.
The assessment identified three lessons to be learned from the Ghana Trade and Investment Gateway project, (i) in the context of Ghana where fiscal incentives of Free Zones apply to the entire country, the original concept of the Free Zone enclave did not work. A multi-purpose industrial park, which targets all types of investors instead of only export-oriented companies, is a more suitable model in this environment; (ii) effective market research and flexible project design are crucial elements for success of a public-private partnership project; and (iii) institutional reforms and trade logistics improvement can play a significant role in facilitating trade.",Country :  Ghana,Content Type : Reports,"December 11, 2013

            Finance Corporation, or IFC and this review covers the joint
            program of the two institutions. The World Bank Group (WBG)
            sought to support Kazakhstan's efforts organizing its
            objectives around four pillars that revolved around the
            central issue of improving its competitiveness. Under pillar
            one, the WBG's support aimed at reducing losses in
            competitiveness through prudent management of the oil
            revenues and increased public sector efficiency. Under
            pillar two, the WBG strategy focused on buttressing efforts
            to promote competitiveness by strengthening the
            government's capacity to identify and reduce barriers
            to businesses and private investors. Under pillar three, the
            WBG supported building the foundation for future
            competitiveness by investing in human capital and basic
            infrastructure. Under pillar four, the WBG support aimed at
            supporting Kazakhstan in ensuring future growth will not
            harm the environment and past liabilities are mitigated.
            These objectives were reaffirmed at the time of the CPSPR. ",Country :  Kazakhstan,Content Type : Reports,"April 25, 2012

Kyrgyz Republic - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2003-06 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The 2003 country assistance strategy
            (CAS) for the Kyrgyz Republic had three objectives: (1)
            supporting private sector-led growth; (2) providing
            essential services; and (3) strengthening the governance
            framework. The strategy was substantially relevant, but over
            the CAS period the strategy became progressively less
            realistic as the political situation became more turbulent
            and the country authorities' reluctance to reform was
            more evident. The lack of progress in several key areas
            ought to have triggered a more coherent transition from the
            base case to the low case. The low case lending program
            called for in the CAS came to United States (U.S.) 97
            million dollars, although a full immediate transition to the
            low case may not have been appropriate. The CAS completion

Honduras - Country Partnership Strategy : CAS Completion Report - IEG review, Web Resource,"The strategy in this Country
            Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Honduras was relevant and the
            proposed lending and non-lending were well aligned with the
            strategy. The CAS included about 20 quantified and concrete
            Key Benchmark Indicators for evaluating CAS results. The CAS
            lending proposals and most of the core economic and sector
            work (ESW) were almost fully delivered as planned. The ESW
            served not only to underpin IDA's own strategy, but
            also provided much intellectual input for other donors and
            the Government. A Debt Relief credit was added to the basic
            program, when Honduras reached the HlPC completion point.
            However, the core objective of the CAS was not achieved.
            Growth did accelerate but there has been little progress in
            reducing poverty or inequality. The Key Benchmark indicator
            in this regard, a reduction in extreme poverty, shows an
            increase instead. However, important advances were made in
            other areas of the CAS program as most of the other Key
            Benchmark indicators were achieved. Foremost among these

Brazil - First Programmatic Development Policy Loan for Sustainable Environmental Management Project, Web Resource,"Ratings for the First Programmatic
            Development Policy Loan (DPL) for Sustainable Environmental
            Management Project for Brazil were as follows: outcome was
            unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate;
            Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and Borrower
            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons
            learned included: certain aspects of the World Bank's
            policies and guidance on development policy lending should
            be clarified. Particularly for DPLs focused on reforms in a
            sector - rather than on macro-economic stability - the
            impacts of the actions supported can often not be adequately
            perceived within the short timeframe of the loan, making
            monitoring and evaluation of outcomes difficult.
            Back-loading of reforms in a DPL programmatic series can
            increase the risk of later loans in the series being
            canceled without full realization of the objectives of the
            series. In future, when attempting to support reforms in
            state-owned banks like National Bank for Economic and Social
            Development (of Brazil) (BNDES) that finance both public and
            private-sector investments, it will be important to take a
            one World Bank Group approach. The level of government
            targeted by DPL reforms should be consistent with the
            outcomes intended and the client country's

            satisfactory project outcome, likely sustainability, and
            substantial institutional development, as well as
            satisfactory performances by both the Bank, and Borrower. A
            number of lessons confirm that restructuring can make
            eventual privatization process more manageable, but
            significant performance improvement should not be expected
            in the interim. Similarly, substantial investment in the
            interim should be avoided as possible, since prospective
            concessionaires do not always put commensurate values on
            these investments. Furthermore, the creation of two separate
            entities by the Malawi railway restructuring, to manage the
            reorganized railway operation, and to carry out the
            retrenchment of staff, and disposal of surplus assets,
            proved a valuable exercise. It is conveyed that intense
            policy dialogue with the government should be kept, to
            maintain the focus on privatization, exemplified by the
            project's conditionality to make substantial
            disbursements, conditional on progress on the privatization
            agenda, a useful instrument that gave good privatization

            retrenchment, careful planning, and rigorous economic, and
            social assessment is required, thus, an analysis on the

            unsatisfactory, with uncertain sustainability, and the EPIV

            addition to reductions in teacher salaries, at the expense
            of needed training time, and, the EPIV downgrading reflects
            the unsuccessful provision of textbooks, which limits

            institutional efficiency were not achieved. The two projects
            offer six main lessons: 1) There are benefits to dropped
            projects as well as costs. The longer-term benefits to the
            lending program of dropping the Forestry Development Project
            probably would have been substantial. 2) Where significant
            reversals of a considered Bank position are made at
            negotiations, a rationale should be provided in the project
            documentation. 3) The Bank should be proactive on governance
            at the sectoral level as well as the country level. 4)
            Safeguards violations should be made a routine element of
            project supervision and the vigilance should not be confined

            In isolation from economy-wide fiscal reform and in an
            environment of declining budgetary resources, it is naive to
            expect that staff retrenchment savings will be left with a

Pakistan - First and Second Telecommunications Projects, Web Resource,"The First and Second
            Telecommunications Projects in Pakistan contributed to the
            substantial expansion of the country's
            telecommunication services. One problem that arose in the
            implementation of these projects related to the fact that
            International Development Association (IDA) financed only
            parts of systems which, for effective use, required the
            completion of other major works financed from other sources.
            Another problem concerned the attempt to improve the
            organization and management of the Telegraph and Telephone
            Department (T&T). The period during which these projects
            were carried out was a particularly difficult one for
            Pakistan. T&T's activities were upset along with
            the whole economy by the events leading to and resulting
            from the separation of Bangladesh. Although by the time
            disbursements had been completed on the second credit, most

            had been completed or were underway, this was only
            accomplished at a considerably slower pace than planned and
            with large cost overruns. A particularly important shortfall
            was the failure of T&T to obtain a new status within the
            government structure that would have enabled it to operate
            efficiently. In spite of continuous concern expressed by IDA

"""Cool Markets"" for GHG Emission Reduction in a Warming World: Evaluation of World Bank Group’s Support to Carbon Finance (Approach Paper)", PDF file,"Carbon finance (CF) has been one of the Bank Group’s first and longest engagements for mitigating climate change. Carbon finance as a subcomponent of climate finance is a generic term used for the revenue streams that can be generated by sale of project-based GHG emission reductions or from payments involving carbon sequestration and storage from forests. The World Bank Group launched CF with interest to support development of a global carbon market that will reduce the cost of achieving GHG emission reductions and facilitate sustainable development. The purpose of this evaluation is to assess the role and contributions of the WBG in CF in relation to the needs and priorities of its clients and its potential comparative advantages and draw lessons to inform the WBG’s strategic direction in CF. The evaluation will look at the four dimensions to assess the potential comparative advantages of the WBG in CF. On the WBG portfolio, the focus will only be on the CF portfolio and will not include the broad scope of climate finance. The primary audience for this evaluation is the WBG’s Board of Directors, senior management and staff involved in carbon finance, climate mitigation policy and related operations. Other stakeholders include the donor sponsors providing trust funds to the WBG. These stakeholders will have an incentive to know about the performance and effectiveness of the carbon finance activities, the key drivers of success, how those drivers changed over time, and how future operations can be improved. The evaluation will also be of interest to climate policy evaluation specialists and researchers as well as policymakers and regulatory agencies who want to understand the impact of WBG operations on international carbon finance and how carbon finance operations or similar GHG mitigation policies could be made more effective. Bilateral and multilateral institutions may also be interested to know about what works in carbon finance. Host country governments, civil society and NGOs will also have an interest in this evaluation, especially in terms of how such interventions contribute to reducing GHG emissions and create opportunities for sustainable social and economic development at different levels.", ,Content Type : Reports,"June 26, 2017

The Global Fund has since become the largest of the120 global and regional partnership programs in which the World Bank is currently involved,disbursing more than $3 billion in grants to developing and transition countries in 2010.The World Bank plays three major roles in the Global Fund: (a) as the trustee of donorcontributions to the Global Fund, (b) in the corporate governance of the program, and (c) asa development partner at the global and country levels. This Review found that the Bankhas had extensive engagement with the Global Fund at the global level through the GlobalHIV/AIDS Program, the International Health Partnership, and related initiatives, but hasbeen less engaged at the country level.
The Global Fund has fostered new approaches to development assistance. This Reviewfound that its Country Coordinating Mechanisms have successfully brought country-levelstakeholders together to submit grant proposals to the Global Fund, but have lacked theauthority and the resources to exercise effective oversight of grant implementation. The situationhas improved in recent years in terms of the World Bank and other partnersÊ¼ providingtechnical assistance in support of Global Fund activities, but these technical support functionsneed to be defined with greater clarity and formality within the context of improveddonor harmonization.
Collective donor efforts have contributed to increased availability and use of disease-controlservices, particularly for HIV/AIDS, and increased coverage of affected communities.However, sustaining client countriesÊ¼ disease-control programs in the face of deceleratingexternal support will require a substantially more coordinated approach than has occurred todate.

            weak, the lack of donor coordination may seriously undermine
            development progress. Second, there is a compelling need for
            the Bank's project work to be solidly grounded in prior

Bangladesh - Third Rural Electrification Project, Web Resource,"The audit rates the outcome of the
            project as highly satisfactory, sustainability as highly
            likely, and institutional development as high. Lessons
            suggest that attributable to the success of the project was
            in part, the availability of the master plan, a tried tested
            model, strengthened by technical assistance from the US
            National Rural Electrification Cooperative Association.
            However, even without a sound master plan, the project would
            not have succeeded in the absence of long-term commitments
            by the Government. It is important to note the unique
            division of labor in the Bangladesh system of rural
            electrification: the cooperatives handle consumer services,
            and operational aspects; the (apex) Rural Electrification
            Board performs a quasi-regulatory function, and provides
            finance, technical inputs, and training; and, the private
            sector carries out construction. This is a promising model,
            noteworthy for its transparency, and the quality of
            performance monitoring. Nonetheless, the feasibility of
            serving poorer households needs to be more carefully
            researched, for it is possible that a tradeoff between
            coverage of the poorest households, and the financial
            performance of the cooperatives become effective, so, those
            poorer households - capable of paying domestic electricity
            tariffs - may nonetheless be cut off from grid supply,
            because they cannot afford upfront connection costs. This
            may be the case for providing a targeted subsidy to cover
            these one-time costs. ",Country :  Bangladesh,Content Type : Reports,"June 14, 2001

Philippines - First and Second Rural Finance Projects, Web Resource,"The audit rates both the First, and
            Second Rural Finance Projects (RFPI and RFPII) as
            satisfactory, likewise for both the Bank, and Borrower
            performances, concurring with the Implementation Completion
            Report (ICR) ratings. However, the audit rates
            sustainability as likely for both operations, downgrading
            the RFPII highly satisfactory ICR rating, given that
            Government losses are implied by current foreign exchange
            rates, while on-lending was entirely in local currency, an
            inadequate risk, particularly in the wake of the Asian
            crisis. Among the lessons learned, the importance for
            long-term sustainability is addressed, suggesting that
            narrowing the project focus could be double-edged, for while
            realistic focus narrowing did achieve targeted results, the
            narrowing that took place between RFPI and RFPII was not
            successful, to the extent that potential policy
            conditionalities were avoided, which could weaken
            institutional development. In addition, disruptions in the
            financial system, such as subsidizing interest rates,
            adversely affects market-based financial development,
            instead policy reforms should address financial
            liberalization, to include, not only decontrol of interest
            rates, but elimination of restrictions that limit
            competition. Basically, sustainability of credit operations,

            (YTEPP) as satisfactory. The project did achieve a sound
            level of technical sustainability, but it failed to engage
            the government on the critical issue of financial
            sustainability. Also the report finds that several
            trade-offs were made at the design stage that compromised
            the project's sustainability. Most significant was the
            packaging of the project as a temporary program. The project
            experience provides several insights of broad applicability.
            1) It is important to balance responsiveness to
            borrowers' requests for loans with selectivity based on
            likely value-added for the country. In this case, the
            investments made are unlikely to sustain a flow of benefits
            in the long term. 2) Justification for Bank financing needs
            to be based on economic analysis, taking into account the
            economic costs and returns on the investment and the most
            efficient use of Bank borrowing for the country. 3) It is
            necessary to address the points made at internal review in
            substance rather than by window-dressing. In this project,
            the issue of financial sustainability was not squarely
            addressed and left problems to be resolved during
            implementation. 4) It is important to build in evaluations
            to allow policy-makers to assess the case for continued
            support for a project, based on empirical findings about
            achievements and shortcomings relative to a control group. ",Country :  Trinidad and Tobago,Content Type : Reports,"June 12, 2000

            Modernization Project) generally agrees with the ratings
            assigned by the respective Implementation Completion

            projects' objectives were appropriate and well
            executed, save the railway component of the Transport
            Project. Lessons learned in technical assistance include: a

China - Gansu Provincial Development Project - Agriculture Component, Web Resource,"This project's overall outcome
            is rated as marginally satisfactory, given that part of the
            irrigation component is incomplete and that implementation
            was long, difficult, and expensive, with high cost overruns.
            Sustainability is rated likely and institutional development
            is rated as modest. The performance of the World Bank is
            rated unsatisfactory, given that the haste to proceed before
            the project was properly prepared proved to be a costly
            decision which could not be overcome fully during a much
            extended implementation period. These are the main lessons
            drawn: When complex engineering components are involved,
            careful evaluation of all aspects of the engineering design
            by a third partt--preferably a reputable international
            engineering firm--should be required for project approval.
            (Operational Manual Statement 2.28 on the state of project
            preparation at approval remains valid.) Using local
            consultants with suitable qualifications and experience can
            provide savings to the Borrower, but this policy should take
            full account of quality and capacity considerations.
            Understandings of counterpart funds should clearly specify
            which government--central, provincial, or local--is
            responsible for providing funds and should include a
            schedule. There is a potential for reducing poverty, even in

            development and improvement together with efficient use of
            scarce water resources. ",Country :  China,Content Type : Reports,"June 23, 1999

Indonesia - Industrial Restructuring Project, Web Resource,"The overall assessment of the project
            was unsatisfactory, and will not be sustainable. On balance,
            the project's complex design, dependent on the
            successful precision of all its components, and based on
            implicit financial and economic assumptions, was conducive
            to unsatisfactory results from both, the Bank, and the
            Borrower. Project preparation was deficient in analyzing the
            factors which over time, would shape the long-term credit
            demand; and, conversely, the borrower's passiveness at
            crucial phases of implementation, led to difficulties in
            loan collection, and, failure in structuring demand-driven
            services, coupled with agencies conflicts. Among the lessons
            learned, it is suggested that credit components require
            solid analysis to be justified, as this case shows, the
            elasticity for credit demand with respect to the interest
            rate, purely based on the government statements, should not
            have been considered as such. In addition, implementation
            responsibilities, and Bank supervision, needs to be both,
            clearly defined since inception, and, tightly monitored. It
            is emphasized that complex credit components, require the
            responsibility of an ""apex"" institution for
            adequate liaison with Bank staff. Technical assistance
            should be supportive of the demand driven credit components,
            to accompany sound economic and financial indicators for

            institutional development as modest, Bank performance as
            satisfactory, and Borrower performance as unsatisfactory.
            Four key lessons emerge from this project. First, improving
            the execution of routine road maintenance requires
            simultaneously stimulating the local construction industry
            by making the size and duration of contracts more attractive
            by establishing pluri-annual programming, and by improving
            the equipment leasing company's management and
            equipment to better serve the needs of local contractors.
            Second, assessing progress and attainment of goals in key
            areas of highway operation requires improving monitoring,
            notably instituting a more rigorous and systematic rating of
            road condition, traffic counting, and keeping track of the
            achievement of important policies such as contracting out.
            Third, the idea to prioritize road maintenance expenditures
            by defining a 'core road network' is sound, but to
            avoid further hurting the more isolated and poor people,
            implementation requires a comprehensive view of the whole
            network, including assistance strategies for the population
            near roads excluded from the central government maintenance
            budget. Fourth, road funding mechanisms should be based on a
            full macroeconomic and sectoral dialogue, notably to define
            the terms and conditions under which a Road Fund would be advisable. ",Country :  Mali,Content Type : Reports,"March 10, 1999

            development was modest, sustainability is likely, and the
            performance of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory.
            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First, a
            less ambitious approach, focused on a few critical issues
            for which the Bank could provide better professional support
            and the Government could deliver, would probably have
            yielded more timely results. Second, instead of waiving loan
            conditions or shifting them to new operations, the Bank
            should have insisted on specific action plans with
            performance indicators that could be monitored to measure
            compliance with loan covenants. Third, considering the lead
            time required for institutional reform, more time should
            have been invested in preparatory work to analyze options
            for the organizational and financial restructuring of key
            sector entities and alternative regulatory frameworks.
            Finally, studies, whose conclusions affect policy reform and
            structural issues foreseen under a sector adjustment loan,
            should be launched before such a loan is approved and should
            not be left to other donors to finance or supervise, unless
            a specific mechanism to coordinate donor efforts is in place. ",Country :  Pakistan,Content Type : Reports,"June 6, 1997

            Only 27,000 metric tons were constructed compared to the
            original target of 40,000 metric tons. Second, there were

            Several lessons can be learned from this experience. First,
            during preparation, overemphasis on the physical aspects of
            grain storage and relative neglect of the policy environment
            and institutional weaknesses led to an unbalanced project
            proposal. To avoid these problems, projects must be
            thoroughly prepared and appraised before their

            to rectify the deficiencies in the project was only partly

            Only 27,000 metric tons were constructed compared to the
            original target of 40,000 metric tons. Second, there were

            Several lessons can be learned from this experience. First,
            during preparation, overemphasis on the physical aspects of
            grain storage and relative neglect of the policy environment

Pakistan - Ninth and Tenth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation Projects, Web Resource,"The Ninth and Tenth Industrial Credit
            and Investment Corporation Projects in Pakistan objectives
            have been met only partially. Throughout the period the Bank
            devoted intensive supervision to Pakistan Industrial Credit
            and Investment Corporation (PICIC) and took an active role
            in discussing with PICIC how best to tackle the serious
            arrears problem. Success was obtained on reaching a solution
            on the servicing of Bangladesh connected liabilities. This
            solution called for the Government of Pakistan (GOP) to
            provide PICIC with all the necessary non-interest bearing
            financial assistance, which will not be called in for
            repayment except in the measure that PICIC recovers related
            assets in Bangladesh. Consequently, both assets and
            liabilities in this respect are presently carried in
            correspondingly off-settling contingent accounts in
            PICIC's balance statements. PICIC's own
            institutional problems could not be fully corrected during
            the period under review, and this fact continued to affect
            its project development, appraisal, and supervision
            activities. The arrears' problem has proven
            particularly intractable in spite of PICIC's efforts
            and the (GOP)'s assistance. As this problem is
            presently being addressed in a more practical manner,
            PICIC's management should be able to concentrate on
            other institutional aspects as well as in renewed

            project, location of project sites, and size of settlers

6 lessons for aligning investments in K-12 private schools with the goal of quality education for all, Web Resource,"Enrollment in private primary and secondary education in developing countries has been rising for more than a decade. This comes as public systems struggle to cope with the demand from growing populations. Private kindergarten to grade 12 (K-12) schools have also attracted support from development finance institutions (DFIs) as, in theory, private schools could both ease the pressure on government resources and help achieve Sustainable Development Goal 4. While the evidence on the development impacts of this support is mixed, a recent report offers several lessons to consider for avoiding the risks associated with private schools and ensuring future approaches are aligned with the overall aim of promoting equitable and inclusive access to quality education.

The report by the Independent Evaluation Group assesses the experience of the World Bank Group’s private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which invested in K-12 private schools from the mid-1990s until a decision in 2017 to halt all investments. The Evaluation of International Finance Corporation Investments in K–12 Private Schools looks at the challenge of supporting private schools in low and middle-income countries while aiming to promote equitable access and reach students from underserved and excluded populations. In response to the IEG report, IFC has announced that it will not resume its investments for the foreseeable future, but the lessons learned from its experiences are relevant for any development finance institution currently invested or considering future investments in private K-12 schools.

Preconditions for investment. Any investment first needs strong roots in the relevant country context and in the local education systems within which the private K-12 school operates. This is especially important to avoid the risk of reinforcing social and educational inequalities. The literature on the role of private education cites a number of examples in which improved test results in private schools is the result of systemically selecting students who are already better prepared to learn. Rather than improving overall access this dynamic can lead to the one-way movement of more privileged students from public to private schools, and leave behind more marginalized students, such as children with disabilities and out-of-school children. A clear understanding of the context in which private K-12 schools operate is vital for anticipating the impact that investment may have on the education system and the community at large, and for the design of approaches that meet potential gaps in the supply of quality education that have a positive effect on equity of access.

Engagement with stakeholders. To build a clear understanding of the local context, investors should consult not only with the client or private school owner but with a broad range of stakeholders. Along with other DFIs, the aim should be to build an extensive coalition that includes a full range of groups with a stake in the education system, such as civil society organizations, local governments, education regulators at the national level, parent organizations, and teacher unions. This extensive coalition will improve the investor’s understanding of the education system and create the synergies needed to achieve the broader development goals. Working with this broader group of stakeholders will allow investors to help support access and quality learning that goes beyond enrolling middle-class and higher-income students. The report found that a range of DFIs, recognizing the complexity of education systems, recently reviewed their investment policies for private K–12 education and as a result, committed to piloting and testing innovations around building coalitions that engage key stakeholders. As these developments are recent, the results are not yet known.

Private-public collaboration. More strategic collaboration and cooperation between private and public sector schools may support planned, positive spillovers from innovations in curricula, teaching, and learning that are built on a clear understanding of the local context. Among the many global, regional and local experts with whom the IEG report team consulted, local civil society organizations, in particular, noted the potential for private schools to pilot best practices in teaching and share them with public schools. However, IFC and World Bank officials underscored the challenges involved in realizing this type of cross-fertilization, with a lot of work needed to nurture these relationships. Private schools alone cannot be expected to promote positive spillovers, as case studies showed that they have little incentive to create systemwide demonstration effects, but rather a combination of government regulations and strong implementation support is needed to catalyze public and private collaboration.

An education rationale. Along with a focus on the financial viability of specific schools, investors should also consider the development impact in decisions. A broader framework is needed for guiding investments in private K–12 schools, that incorporates goals such as reaching vulnerable or excluded groups (for example, out-of-school children) and improving the quality of education without exacerbating inequality.  It also should require investing in schools that are committed to links with a full range of beneficiaries and stakeholders in the local education system—such as school administrators, parent associations, and teachers.

Longer term investment horizons. Investors will need to consider the trade-offs between ensuring the financial sustainability of investments in private K–12 schools and supporting equitable access, education quality, and broader education system effects. K-12 education is a challenging sub-sector.  Investments in private K–12 schools are dominated by traditional financing—including individual and family entrepreneurs—and in the last decade by private equity and impact investors. The investable market is limited. Family-run private K–12 schools tend to be small. The small size and relative business immaturity of many private K–12 schools, particularly low-fee schools, inhibit their scalability. These various factors suggest the need for longer-term investment horizons for private K–12 schools coupled with technical support from investors.

Monitoring and evaluation. Effective systems are needed to monitor the impacts of investments in private K–12 schools, and to learn from them. This requires going beyond business indicators to include assessment of education access and equity of access, quality of education, and effects on other schools and local education systems. This should also include monitoring of factors such as accommodations for children with disabilities, the effect of initiatives such as scholarships to support access for low-income or out-of-school children, and constant learning to address potential negative effects on the education system.

As governments struggle to meet growing demands, the mobilization of finance for education will remain an urgent priority.  In 2020, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) projected a shortfall of $148 billion annually in the financing needed to achieve the SDG4 by 2030. The impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic are estimated to have raised that figure to as much as $200 billion annually. The private sector could have a role in addressing this shortfall and contributing to the achievement of SDG4, but only if it can ensure both improvements to the quality of education and equitable access.

Europe and Central Asia - Agricultural Reform Support and Agricultural Development Projects, Web Resource,"This report provides lessons of experience and reflects the findings from a thematic cluster of project performance assessment reports (PPARs) on farm restructuring in transition economies in Europe and Central Asia. World Bank projects in five countries form the basis of this review. In all the five countries â Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Romania and Tajikistan â there was an extreme urgency when the projects were being designed to resuscitate primary agricultural production and the agribusiness following the end of Soviet era. The Bank kept a detailed scorecard of sector reform progress. The biggest strides were taken by Romania (spurred by the EU accession). Armenia and Azerbaijan also did fairly well; but Georgia regressed (owing to the disruption caused by civil strife) and Tajikistan languished, remaining to a large extent a planned economy. With respect to specific areas of reform, price and market liberalization advanced most. There was less progress with solving the financing problems of agriculture, the liberalization of agro-processing and input supply, and with institutional reform.", ,Content Type : Reports,"June 25, 2010

IEG fully agrees with the CAS and ISN CR lessons and suggestions, notably the need to take into account the stress factors from the 2010 crisis, with a more analytical approach to the country's political economy. Most CAS and ISN CR lessons - flexibility, selectivity, simplicity, effective partnerships and outreach with broad stakeholder group repeat those of the FY 2007 CAS and ISN CR, suggesting that this should be given far greater attention by management.

            is critical for success. Projects often have components
            involving multiple ministries, but these can be successfully
            implemented when there is a strong stakeholder commitment to
            reform and when there is political and administrative
            commitment to setting and achieving high-quality standards.
            Second, beside academic qualifications, criteria for
            awarding fellowships should include work experience and
            activities indicating leadership ability. Third, while using
            well-trained and dedicated teachers as supervisors may
            significantly promote high achievement, it takes them out of
            the classroom and may undermine the purpose. Fourth,
            suitable incentives are needed to create a pool of qualified
            and effective teachers. Fifth, fellowship programs need
            components of cost recovery, clear prioritizing of local
            needs, and clear selection criteria to raise the
            population's confidence level regarding the

            Strategy (CPS) and the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) of FY10
            and evaluates the CPSCR. The CPS was a joint strategy

            Development (IBRD), International Finance Corporation (IFC),
            and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and this
            review covers their joint program. The World Bank Group
            (WBG) strategy objectives were organized around three
            pillars. Under pillar one, the strategy sought to support
            competitiveness and employment opportunities, which
            involved: sustained macroeconomic stability and sustained
            economic growth; increased private investment, export
            competitiveness, and a deeper and broader financial sector;
            increased employment; and reliable and efficient energy
            supply. Under pillar two the World Bank Group (WBG) was to
            support equitable human and social development, through
            increasing effectiveness of social security, making the
            health system more effective, enhancing the educational
            system and increasing sensitivity to demand for labor. Under
            pillar three the WBG aimed at supporting an efficient
            provision of high quality public services, through
            rationalized and well-structured public expenditures,
            strengthened public sector governance, and improved local
            service delivery and disaster preparedness. The strategy
            objectives were confirmed in the CPSPR, with greater

Republic of Congo - Support for Economic Diversification Project, Web Resource,"Ratings for the Support for Economic
            Diversification Project were as follows: Outcome was
            moderately unsatisfactory, Overall efficacy was negligible
            for original PDO and modest for revised PDO, Bank
            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Quality of
            monitoring and evaluation was modest. This assessment offers
            the following lessons: (i) When working with low-capacity
            clients, especially in countries affected by fragility,
            conflict, and violence, design should be simple with a
            minimum of components and limited requirements for
            coordination. (ii) For investment climate reform type
            projects, particularly in countries with strong centralized
            power dynamics, a key champion at the highest level of the
            government and coordination among the various ministries are
            crucial to bringing the public and private sectors together
            and helping identify and implement the reforms needed to
            improve the investment climate and competitiveness. (iii) It
            is crucial for projects involving large counterpart funding,
            especially in countries where public revenues are highly
            dependent on natural resources, to consider the risk of
            commodity price fluctuations for counterpart funding at the
            time of appraisal and seek to mitigate such risk. (iv) A
            matching grant scheme should clearly identify the needs of
            the beneficiaries at the time of the project design,
            especially in countries similar to the Republic of Congo
            that lack an entrepreneurship mind-set, have a large

            Assistance Evaluation for China. Hence, the report goes
            beyond individual project assessments to examine relevant
            cross-sectoral issues. The eight assessed projects supported
            the Government of China's development strategies in
            five sectors: agriculture, forestry, education, health, and
            transport. All were approved between 1990 and 1996 and
            closed between December 1997 and 2001. Three of them closed
            behind schedule. Project ratings ranged between
            ""moderately satisfactory"" and
            ""satisfactory."" Three projects had project ratings
            of ""moderately satisfactory"" while the rest were
            ""satisfactory."" Six of the projects were likely to

            as highly satisfactory. Two broad categories of lessons with
            implications for the Bank's future involvement are
            offered: 1) To enhave development impact, attention to
            institutional issues is essential, as is continued and
            deepening Bank engagement. 2) To strengthen the focus on
            poverty reduction, improve targeting, coordinate sectoral

Russian Federation - Highway Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project, Web Resource,"The audit rates outcome as moderately
            unsatisfactory and institutional development as modest.
            Sustainability is rated as non-evaluable because the
            government in 2000 abolished a dedicated Road Fund that
            ensured adequate funding for road maintenance, and it is too
            early to pass a well-founded judgement on future funding
            from the central budget. World Bank performance is rated
            unsatisfactory because of the project's inadequate
            quality at entry and poor performance during the mid-term
            review (including failure to formally restructure the
            project). Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory
            because, despite a mostly good performance of the
            implementing agency, it was weak in pursuing the
            institutional objectives and made no progress in developing
            an accounting and auditing system for the Road Fund, which
            would have improved its financial management and likely
            avoided its demise. This experience confirms the following
            OED lessons: A wide-scope project design for a first-time
            Bank operation in a sector makes sense only if the operation
            will launch initiatives that will be continued in follow-on
            projects. Project implementation units (PIU) may be
            essential in transition countries. the use of a phased
            approach that starts with pilot components is advisable,
            especially in transition economies subject to significant
            economic, political, and institutional uncertainties, but
            achieving maximum effectiveness requires an early assessment
            of the pilots' results and the option to redesign. ",Country :  Russian Federation,Content Type : Reports,"November 29, 2001

Bulgaria - Telecommunications Project, Web Resource,"The project's overall outcome is
            rated as satisfactory, its sustainability as likely, and its
            institutional development impact as high. Although the
            Borrower's performance is rated highly satisfactory, it
            notes that the performance of the telecommunications
            commission and privatization agency was mixed and that
            mistakes were made that may have reduced the chance of
            successful sale of the BTC. OED rates the Bank's
            overall performance satisfactory, including its effective
            coordination with cofinanciers, although it notes that the
            Bank was perceived by BTC as slow and bureaucratic at times
            when speed was needed and by some senior officals as taking
            a cautious approach when timely advice would have been more
            helpful during a complex privatization process. Some other
            lessons: Privatization transactions should be designed for
            maximum flexibility (options) to respond to market shifts
            and unanticipated events, and need to be balanced with the
            specificity required to ensure transparency in evaluation.
            Bank staff need clearer and more specific guidance to enable
            them to respond flexibly, yet consistently, across sectors
            and countries, to government requests for advice during the
            structuring and negotiation of complex infrastructure
            privatizations. A strong local champion and project design
            matching local implementation were key factors. An aptly
            prepared investment loan, combined with technical
            assistance, can be an effective vehicle for broad sector

Malawi - The First and Second Education Sector Credit Projects, Web Resource,"OED rates outcomes as satisfactory
            though marginally so. Despite the problems, the projects
            achieved a threefold expansion in classroom capacity, well
            beyond original expectations. In urban areas, enrollment in
            primary school has become the social norm. Nevertheless,
            delays allowed rapid increases in the school-aged population
            to outpace the enrollment increases. Primary education
            remains far from universal and dropout and graduation rates
            remain high, especially for the rural poor, while student
            achievement levels have declined drastically. Institutional
            impact is rated as modest. OED rates sustainability as
            uncertain in light of recent developments Budgetary
            shortfalls cast doubt on the government's commitment to
            complete the unfinished business in primary education and
            put at risk in a pre-election period the widespread public
            support for the mass education policy. IDA's
            performance is rated as satisfactory overall, though the
            lack of realism is cause for concern because of the economic
            costs of delays and shortfalls. OED proposes that
            staff's preoccupation with the long-term policy reforms
            and their very commitment and responsiveness to the
            countries' educational needs may have led them to
            regard the implementation risks as a normal cost of doing
            business. In turn this may have encouraged day-to-day

            satisfactory project outcome, modest institutional
            development impact, and uncertain sustainability. Although
            the project early performance was hindered by the lack of
            capacity at the local level, and a slow decentralization,
            the programs introduced following the Midterm Review, built
            local capacity through appropriate training, and technical
            assistance, which may well lead to sustainable likelihood in
            later projects, owing to increased capacity of local
            governments, and communities. Lessons suggest that: 1)
            effective community-based development requires technical
            support to communities, to ensure quality of works, in
            addition to financial inputs, particularly recurrent cost
            financing, to ensure adequate operations, and maintenance of
            works. Moreover, information dissemination between
            responsible institutions, down to the community level should
            be provided regularly, within each type of organization; 2)
            fostering a learning culture requires not just ensuring the
            supply of rigorous evaluations, but creating a demand for
            them as well; 3) the expression of community choices should
            be preceded by an information campaign, and community
            sensitization, prior to the offer of funds; 4) an early
            analysis of the institutional context would preclude
            undermining of existing institutions; and, 5) sector reforms

            project can be an effective mechanism for such integration.
            c) The economic empowerment impact of a stand-alone WID
            project can be enhanced if a project focuses on women's
            social and economic needs in an integrated manner. d)
            Start-up support for research and needs assessment is an
            important foundation for proper design, and can initiate a

            three projects covered by this audit report comprise the
            entire International Development Association (IDA)/Bank
            assistance to Bolivian agriculture in general and rural
            development in particular, between 1976 and 1987. In the
            mid-1970s, the Government's strategy for agriculture
            and rural development emphasized the reduction of the
            country's dependence on imported foodstuffs and the
            alleviation of acute poverty and underemployment in
            Bolivia's highlands, the Altiplano. For the latter
            objective, public agricultural investment was directed
            towards integrated rural development projects to provide
            basic social services to increase the productivity of
            subsistence agriculture. The Ingavi Project was the first
            example in Bolivia of such an integrated approach and was
            followed, relatively quickly, by the Ulla Ulla and
            OmAsuyos-Los Andes projects as development models for the
            region of the Altiplano and the adjoining intermediate
            valleys. Earlier IDA assistance to Bolivia included two
            simple agricultural credit projects for commercial beef
            development in the tropical lowlands and another two credit
            operations (1971-1980) in support of small-scale farmers in
            the Altiplano. This projects aimed at increasing crop or
            livestock production and beneficiary incomes by forming
            farmer groups to facilitate delivery of services (technical
            assistance and credit), and providing social infrastructure

            should have taken a less compromising attitude in these
            cases. The Bank also appears to have been weak in following
            its own procurement rules. The late completion of the Third
            Project was primarily due to the use of an inexperienced
            contractor whose pre-qualification the Bank had opposed, and
            who won the contract in the face of no competition. While
            the desire of the Government to engage its own company is
            understandable, the Bank's acquiescence. In this area
            cost the country a high price in the form of congestion and
            shipping rate surcharges. The following lessons can be
            learned from these projects; (a) joint ventures wishing to
            bid on Bank Group projects should be informed that their
            bids will be rejected as non-responsive unless accompanied
            by executed joint venture documentation embodying joint and
            several liability and adequate staff and financing; (b) the

            venture partners which seeks to void joint and several
            liability should ipso facto cause the termination of the
            contract with the borrower with appropriate penalties

            infrastructure component, was fully successful. However the
            implementation of the remaining components, infrastructure
            and technical assistance, was not. The Bank's
            performance was adequate. The main infrastructure component,
            the Bushrod extension, in which the Bank took the initial
            lead at conception, went very well. The Borrowers
            performance was good considering the strains arising from
            the distortion in financial conditions largely created by
            the increase in oil prices, and from the change in
            Government. The impact of the project was considerable. As
            it turned out it has made a great difference to Liberia
            Electricity Corporation (LEC)'s financial position as
            the result of fuel cost savings; while still not good the

It limits its assessment to those partsâhenceforth referred to as the ISN Completion Report (ISN CR) in this reviewâof the broader completion report, which covers eight years when the World Bank Group (WBG) strategy was guided by a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and two ISNs. The choice of focusing only on the FY 2010 ISN is in keeping with IEG's trend towards shorter program assessments, and acknowledges the Executive Board's discussions of the lessons and findings of the two initial periods when considering the most recent strategy documents. This review also evaluates the ISN CR. The FY 2010 ISN was a joint strategy between IDA and IFC, and this review covers the joint program of the two agencies.
IEG concurs with the lessons of the ISN CR, but stresses two additional points. First, the short life span of an ISN calls for a more realistic set of objectives and a for a results framework that can adequately be monitored during the life of the strategy.  An effective monitoring and evaluation framework is essential to adjust the transitory strategy to the progress being made on the ground, and to help the WBG think about the changes in course that would be desirable. Second, a substantive and constructive dialogue with the countryâbegun under the ISNP under reviewâcan help identify areas of common ground between the country's and the WBG's approach to key policy issues.  Approaching the dialogue with an open mind can help open opportunities to promote growth and abate poverty for both IDA and IFC.",Country :  Bolivia,Content Type : Reports,"November 23, 2011

One, to Cameroon, was for building the capacity to monitor the petroleum sector; a second, for Chad, aimed at strengthening the capacity to manage oil development in an environmentally and socially sound manner; and the third, also for Chad, supported the arrangements for managing the oil revenue and improving public expenditure. All were approved in 2000 and became effective in 2001. Moreover, IFC had a number of advisory activities complementing these efforts. Together, these projects and activities were viewed as an integrated cluster (hereafter âthe programâ).

            Reconstruction and Development, and the International
            Development Association (IBRD/IDA) played an important role
            in the Second Highway Project. It encouraged the Government
            to select components of high economic priority for financing
            with scarce resources and to postpone others. In retrospect,
            however, the IBRD/IDA should have paid closer attention to
            transport regulation in the country. Construction of the
            roads and bridges under the Second Highway Project has been
            successfully completed, but with a 29 percent cost overrun
            in local currency terms due to design difficulties,
            construction delays, and price increases. Given the scarce

The strategy covered only IDA's assistance program, and accordingly, this review focuses only on IDA and its program.  

IEG rates the overall outcome of IDA's strategy in Lao PDR as satisfactory, giving special weight to the successful implementation of the transformative NT2 project. Lao PDR is implementing NT2 successfully, without any significantly adverse social or environmental impacts. The improved capacity being created by NT2 is allowing Lao PDR to expand its electric power plans significantly, albeit without support from IDA. On other aspects of the strategy, Lao PDR is becoming better integrated with its neighbors and the rest of the world through trade, with prospects of joining the Asia Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Lao PDR has a mixed record on social indicators, but data is scant.  Indicators show better access to education and a reduction in under-five mortality, but little progress in quality of education and completion rates. Major health indicators are lacking, especially those focused on the poor. In supporting vulnerable and remote communities, progress is being made through the Poverty Reduction Fund (PRF), a successful project that may be scaled up.

Azerbaijan - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2003-05 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The overriding goal of the FY03-05
            Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was to help Azerbaijan
            translate its anticipated temporary oil boom into sustained
            poverty reduction. The strategy for achieving this goal was
            organized around four main objectives: (1) managing the oil
            boom, by maintaining macro-economic stability with growth
            and poverty reduction; (2) generating jobs and non-oil
            growth, focusing on the financial sector, the private sector
            and agriculture; (3) improving social services and
            infrastructure; and (4) ensuring that the potential for oil
            and gas earnings was realized. The CAS objectives and
            structure were directly relevant to Azerbaijan's
            economic challenges, and its own strategy to meet them, and
            are also broadly consistent with the most recent CAE. The
            CAS was a joint IDNIBRDIIFC strategy and was implemented
            closely in line with plans. IEG concurs with most of the
            lessons from the CASCR, especially the importance of
            sustaining a coherent, high quality policy dialogue over
            time, and the need to find an effective vehicle for that
            dialogue with the Government on the large remaining reform
            agenda in the absence of policy based lending. The
            CASCR's highly positive assessment of the
            'programmatic approach' to AAA activities may be
            premature, however, and should be carefully evaluated. This
            review suggests three additional lessons and

            strategy (CAS) and evaluates the 2006 Yemen CAS completion

            sustainable poverty reduction by focusing on: (i) improving
            public sector governance; (ii) improving the investment
            environment; (iii) building and protecting human capital;
            and (iv) sustaining natural resources, particularly water.
            The CASCR rates the outcome of the FY2003-05 CAS
            implementation unsatisfactory due to ambitious targets,
            inappropriate instruments, slow implementation, and a
            fragmented and delayed non-lending program. The CASCR points
            to the need for the subsequent CAS to better balance the
            country's need for short term growth with its need for
            long-term capacity development and public sector
            accountability. The CASCR addresses the Bank's need for
            greater focus on: (a) appropriate lending instruments to
            ensure that the borrower is both willing and able to
            implement the programs as designed, and (b) effective use of
            non-lending instruments to promote greater dissemination of

Sri Lanka - Country assistance strategy : OED comments on CAS completion report, Web Resource,"This brief review of the progress
            towards the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
            objectives and of the Sri Lanka CAS CR has yielded the

            assistance to Sri Lanka since the last CAS appears generally
            consistent with the evolving strategy reflected in both the

            projects in Sri Lanka exiting the portfolio for the period
            FY99-02 falls below the South Asia Region and the Bank. To
            provide a complete picture of the extent to which Bank
            assistance has contributed to meeting the objectives of the
            CAS, the CAS CR needs to discuss Bank lending and
            non-lending activities delivered since the last CAS as they
            relate to specific CAS objectives, and assess the extent to
            which they have had or are likely to have an impact on
            meeting those objectives. The lack of fiscal discipline has
            undermined macroeconomic stability and the ability of the

            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Quality of
            monitoring and evaluation is modest. This assessment offers
            the following lessons: (i) An integrated and participatory
            approach to agricultural development can initiate
            sustainable productivity growth among SHFs. In the context
            of a SHF-dominated agricultural sector and low productivity,
            traditional support measures of input supply are needed to
            close agronomic yield gaps. (ii) Agricultural projects with
            a supply-side focus on productivity growth that ignore
            market linkages are unlikely to provide the right
            agribusiness mind-set or incentives for farmers to
            sustainably invest in longer-term agricultural productivity.
            (iii) A government’s insufficient capacity and resources for
            agricultural sector development make it difficult to
            maintain an innovative but intensive demand-driven approach
            to service delivery in agriculture. (iv) Sustainable land
            and water management practices require a comprehensive
            approach that goes beyond irrigation or demonstration plots.
            (v) For projects preparing an Agriculture Sector-Wide
            Approach, monitoring production outcomes without a
            counterfactual does not allow an understanding of what is
            driving the anticipated productivity increases. ",Country :  Malawi,Content Type : Reports,"January 6, 2021

Ethiopia - Peasant Agricultural Development Project, Web Resource,"Despite difficulties, the overall
            outcome of the project was satisfactory. Institutional
            development is rated substantial. Sustainability is likely.
            World Bank and Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.
            There are three major findings: 1) Tenacity pays off. The
            Bank did not relax its tough ex-ante policy conditionality
            and stayed the course over a long period on what was
            regarded as an unusually risky venture. Even though there
            were marked differences with government policy perspectives,
            the Bank remained a steadfast advocate of reform and was
            thus well-positioned when reform and liberalization
            eventually occurred. 2) Not everything can be done at
            once--limit objectives and package carefully. Appraisal
            developed a complex project that would have diffused the
            reform effort. Fortunately, Bank management cut the project
            scope to focus on what was essential and phased related
            objectives under separate and later credits. This avoided a
            large and difficult comprehensive agricultural development
            project that would have been difficult to manage. 3)
            In-country economic and sector carried out during
            implementation builds local capacity, keeps policy dialogue
            up-to-date, and informs and builds country partnerships. The
            assessment found that some donors established grant-funded
            in-country policy support units to provide feedback on
            sectors in which they operated to keep policy dialogue
            active. This built strong, interactive partnerships with the

Seychelles - Environment and Transport Project, Web Resource,"The overall outcome of the

            that the primary objective to assist Seychelles towards
            sustainable environmental management was not met, and,
            although the secondary objective to sustain tourism growth
            through infrastructure development was substantially
            achieved, there was little progress on institutional reform,
            and strengthening of environmental management. The outcome
            of the Global Environment Facility Biodiversity Conservation
            component, is rated moderately unsatisfactory, i.e., success
            in facilitating the trade ban on sea turtles is offset by
            the negligible impact on policies for, and management of
            marine pollution. The Dutch Trust Fund achieved only one of
            its four objectives, thus its outcome is rated
            unsatisfactory. Consequently, institutional development
            impacts are rated modest, though sustainability is likely
            due to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) commitment, and
            substantial international interest; however, institutional
            development under the Dutch Trust Fund is rated modest,
            while sustainability rating is not evaluated. Lessons
            feature: the importance of the instrument of choice: a
            sectoral adjustment loan can better catalyze achievement of
            policy, and institutional objectives, in light of complex
            projects to supervise; sustainable environmental management
            depends on institutional, and human capital - thus local
            capacity should be enhanced through training, and linkages
            with international environmental management organizations,
            encouraging Government to divest managerial responsibility
            to NGOs and the private sector; and, the Bank should focus

Philippines - Engineering and Science Education Project and Second Vocational Training Project, Web Resource,"The audit report rates the outcomes
            of both the Engineering and Science Education Project (ESEP)
            and Second Vocational Training Project (VTP II) as
            satisfactory. Both projects were efficacious in improving
            the capacities of the education and training system to
            supply skilled manpower. ESEP remains relevant to the
            government's economic and human resource development
            policies and VTP II is highly relevant to poverty reduction.
            Continuing monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities
            keep the focus on results strong and steady. Institutional
            development impact is substantial in both projects at
            central management levels, but is as yet only moderate at
            local levels. The major weakness is that industry
            participation in training skilled workers remains modest. In
            ESEP, however, there is a caveat: alternative funding
            sources must be found to compensate for the discontinuation
            of external funding. Main insights on M&E include: a)
            Capacity development in M&E goes hand-in-hand with
            institutionalizing M&E tasks as regularly expected
            activities. b) At the design stage, all project
            responsibilities requiring M&E tasks need to be
            identified. c) M&E elements are naturally diffused
            across various objectives and components, but they should
            receive detailed attention at the appraisal stage as
            full-fledged components. d) In designing M&E components,
            institutional and stakeholder analysis is important. e) The

Romania - Transport Project, Web Resource,"While the project encountered

            length of road works was less than expected, the project met
            or exceeded difficult institutional objectives and the
            physical components were completed ahead of schedule, with
            satisfactory quality, and high economic returns. Therefore,
            the project is rated as highly satisfactory. Borrower
            performance is rated as highly satisfactory while World Bank
            performance is satisfactory. The following key lessons
            emerge: Effectiveness in donor coordination can best be
            achieved when it starts from project preparation and
            missions are jointly scheduled. Much red tape is avoided
            when an effective agency, free of ministry controls, can be
            put directly in charge of project implementation. Even
            difficult institutional reforms can be achieved quickly when
            there are strong, visionary sectoral political leaders,
            supportive central government authorities, and a highly
            professional team designing and implementing the reforms.
            Also, potential conflicts for investment priorities between
            national and international traffic are easier to avoid in
            the early stages of road modernization. New equipment for
            railways and highways may only partially reduce the total
            operational costs in the activities served by that
            equipment; cost reductions must be matched by reducing

India - Third National Agricultural Extension Project (NAEP III), Web Resource,"This performance audit report rates
            the Third National Agricultural Extension Project in India.
            It was prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department
            (OED) following a mission visit to India in April 1998, and
            is based in part on the Implementation Completion Report
            (ICR) issued by the South Asia Region on December 26, 1996.
            Overall, the outcome of the project is now rated by OED as
            marginally unsatisfactory (the ICR rated it partially
            satisfactory), because so few of the project initiatives are
            going to last. Sustainability is still rated as unlikely
            (the ICR rated it uncertain), considering the prevailing
            negative views and fiscal responsibility of maintaining the
            intended system in most of the project states. Institutional
            development is rated as modest (ICR rated it satisfactory).
            The audit rates bank performance as satisfactory (as did the
            ICR), although only marginally so because of the slowness in
            addressing the structural issues in the system of extension
            being implemented. The audit rates borrower performance as
            satisfactory (as did the ICR), albeit marginally so. The
            main lessons learned relate to the need for further
            improvement to public extension services and facilitating a
            pluralization of financing and of providers. More
            specifically, there is a need for: managerial de-layering,
            greater mobility of field staff, greater use of more
            cost-effective media materials, and reducing numbers of
            staff positions to levels that governments can afford
            sustainably; improvement in monitoring and evaluation; and

            based in part on the Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
            issued by the South Asia Region on April 23, 1997. The OED
            audit rates the overall project outcome as satisfactory (as

            ICR rating was partial). The audit rates the Bank
            performance as unsatisfactory (the ICR rating was

            the assurances of the Government of West Bengal that the
            land transfer and associated resettlement and compensation
            issues would be resolved shortly. During implementation, the
            Bank put too much emphasis on improving Coal India
            Limited's financial performance through price increases
            and paid insufficient attention to the implementation of

            borrowers need to establish participatory decision making by
            the project-affected persons. Second, the Bank should insist
            that land acquisition and compensation issues are fully and
            appropriately resolved before agreeing to participate in
            financing a project. Third, more attention needs to be paid

            one year): (a) to increase land cultivated in the project
            area by 25 percent from 2 to 2.5 million ha, basically by
            expanding farm size and increasing the use of draft-animals
            and animal drawn equipment (the project area comprises about

Arab Republic of Egypt : Integrated Irrigation Improvement and Management Project and Farm-Level Irrigation Modernization Project, Web Resource,"Ratings for the Integrated Irrigation
            Improvement and Management Project are as follows: Outcome
            was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was
            modest, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and
            Borrow performance was moderately satisfactory. Ratings for

            follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to
            development outcome was modest, and Bank performance was
            moderately satisfactory. This assessment offers the
            following lessons: (i) In irrigation systems, such as the
            Nile Delta’s, that are organized along a hierarchical canal
            network, irrigation improvement efforts can realize greater
            impact by applying a systematic approach to rehabilitation,
            as was done through these two projects, as opposed to
            addressing different levels of the canal system in
            isolation. (ii) Efficient implementation of irrigation
            improvement works requires coordinating and sequencing
            activities that fall under the mandate of many different
            entities, which are often beyond the authority of the
            project implementing agency. (iii) Effecting behavior
            changes in on-farm water use, agronomic practices, and
            diversification to higher-value crops requires support
            beyond improvements to the irrigation water delivery system.
            (iv) Successfully reforming the institutions that manage
            irrigation and drainage services, both water users and
            government agencies, requires greater attention to
            incentives for collaboration. (v) In a context such as the
            Nile Delta, where overall efficiency of the irrigation
            system is already high, there is little scope for addressing
            water savings at the basin level through infrastructure improvement. ", ,Content Type : Reports,"July 5, 2022

"Burkina Faso, Ghana and Mali : West Africa transport and transit facilitation project", Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses the development effectiveness of the West Africa Transport and Transit Facilitation Project implemented in three countries: Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Mali. The project was approved on June 19, 2008, for a cost of US$197.2 million, with an International Development Association (IDA) credit of US$190 million. The project cost at completion was US$180.87 million, with US$173.5 million of the IDA credit being utilized. The project was closed on June 30, 2015, with a delay of fifteen months due to delays in release of counterpart funding from the Government of Ghana and suspension of works in Mali (for about 11 months) in the aftermath of the political crisis in March 2012. 

Landlocked economies are disadvantaged by costly and unreliable transport and transit processes. For example, transport and transit costs for countries such as Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger are up to 50 percent higher than for countries with direct sea access. Historically, the Abidjan-Ouagadougou-Bamako Corridor was the main sea access corridor for both Burkina Faso and Mali. However, because of the deteriorating security situation in Côte d'Ivoire, there was an urgent need to seek alternative access to ports for the landlocked countries of Burkina Faso and Mali.

Ratings for the West Africa Transport and Transit Facilitation Project are as follows: Outcome is moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome is substantial, Bank performance is moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance is moderately satisfactory. Lesson from the project include: (i)  A regional approach to implement road rehabilitation works along strategic corridors can enhance the benefits particularly for the landlocked countries by linking them to gateway ports. (ii) It is important to have strong upstream analytical work and technical assistance for regional trade facilitation reforms so that countries can agree early on the technical details of institutional reforms. (iii) When the projects involve Regional Economic Communities (REC), it is important to assess and cover RECs’ funding needs for project coordination and implementation so that they can carry out this function effectively. (iv) The World Bank’s current single-country business model makes it challenging to implement regional projects.

China - ShiZheng Railway Project, Web Resource ,"Railways are vital to China’s social and economic development. As a large economy with a vast geographical area and a huge population, China has massive volumes of passenger and freight traffic moving over medium to long distances. Because of the high demand for rail services, railways are one of the most economic and effective means of transport for the medium- to long-distance transport market in China. They are also more energy-efficient and environment-friendly than other transport modes on a comparable capacity basis. The World Bank initiated a programmatic engagement with China’s railways in 2008 through a program of six projects to support construction of priority high-speed railway (HSR) lines. The program was also intended to be a platform for the World Bank to continue its policy dialogue with the government on railway sector reform. The ShiZheng Railway Project was the first of the six projects. The project’s original objectives were to meet the growing freight and passenger market demand in the railway corridor section between Shijiazhuang and Zhengzhou while substantially improving the level of service offered to customers. After the restructuring in 2012, a new objective was added – to improve the maintenance of the catenary system on high-speed rail lines – but the original objectives were unchanged.

Ratings from the project are as follows: Outcome was satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. The following lessons are drawn from the project experience: (i) Sound technical design, project preparation, and implementation management, combined with assured financial resources and effective interinstitutional collaboration, are a recipe for success for a complex HSR project. (ii) Effective high speed railway systems require certain preconditions. (iii) Successful reforms in large and complex infrastructure sectors such as railways involve sustained policy changes supported through long-term policy dialogue and engagements. (iv) Agglomeration effects are an important benefit of high-speed rail development and could be incorporated in the cost-benefit analysis of such projects. (v) Good connections of HSR lines with other transport modes and between the rail stations and urban centers are critical to achieving the full benefits of high-speed trains.

Colombia - Country partnership strategy (CAS) completion report : IEG review, Web Resource,"The FY08 Country Partnership Strategy
            (CPS) was a joint strategy for the World Bank Group (WBG). A
            CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) was prepared in 2010. This
            review evaluates the CPS and CPSPR and their implementation
            and reviews the CPSCR. It covers both International Bank for
            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International
            Finance Corporation (IFC) activities. Drawing on the
            National Development Plan (NDP), the CPS defined its
            objectives around five pillars: (i) sustained equitable
            growth; (ii) poverty alleviation and equity of
            opportunities; (iii) environment and natural resource
            management; (iv) peace and development; and (v) an efficient
            and effective government. Within these pillars, the
            particular objectives supported by IFC were: (i)
            strengthening the business environment, (ii) improving
            infrastructure and urban services, (iii) strengthening
            financial services (iv) agriculture and rural development,
            (v) education, (vi) renewable energy and new technologies
            for the power sector, and (vii) royalty management. The CPS
            identifies a number of lessons with which IEG agrees. Three
            additional lessons could be highlighted. First, in a
            middle-income country with good monitoring and evaluation
            capacity, the IBRD should rely on the country system to make
            its program more results-oriented. At the time the CPS was
            prepared, Colombia was enjoying high economic growth (an
            average of 6.5 percent per year in 2006 and 2007), with
            rising incomes, a reduction in poverty, and greater
            inclusion for social services. A favorable external
            environment, improving internal security, and a natural
            resource boom contributed to this performance. The global
            economic crisis had a relatively minor impact on the

            2007 Country Partnership Strategy for FY07-10 was well
            aligned with these objectives. Lending was selective and
            both lending and Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA)
            focused on some of the more urgent challenges facing the
            country, including sustaining tourism development and
            strengthening the financial sector. The key lesson that
            follows from the Bank Group's involvement in Montenegro
            is a familiar one, i.e., that borrower ownership of
            interventions matters. Success in the macroeconomic and
            public management areas, as well as in the education sector,
            owed much too strong ownership by counterparts. In both
            cases the government is following through on IBRD-supported
            reforms. Conversely, when important yet politically
            controversial reforms must be undertaken, a concerted prior
            effort among all stakeholders to create ownership is a
            prerequisite for success. This is of particular relevance
            with regard to the resolution of environmental issues to
            make Montenegro's tourism sector sustainable in the
            long run. ",Country :  Montenegro,Content Type : Reports,"January 20, 2011

            This CPS was joint with International Finance Corporation

            Group-World Bank (IEG-WB). The Bank's FY2005-08 CPS
            supported a popular new administration's ambitious
            development program, safe and secure country 2004-09, and
            targeted improved outcomes with regard to trade, cost of
            doing business, fiscal performance, access to and quality of
            health and education, land security and transactions,
            governance, vulnerability, environmental protection, and
            crime and violence. These outcomes were highly relevant to
            country development objectives and were realistically
            attainable. The strategy recognized, three serious risks to
            its full implementation, including a re-emergence of the
            political gridlock that had at various times slowed
            progress, deterioration in the external environment, and the
            occurrence of a natural disaster. Good progress was made,
            with many of the objectives revised per the 2008 CPSPR
            achieved, with regard to Bank assistance supporting
            equitable growth with fiscal consolidation under pillar one

            through implementation and flexible and the response to the
            implementation difficulties that arose. Bank performance was

Costa Rica - Country Partnership Strategy : CAS Completion Report - IEG review, Web Resource,"This review covers the FY04 country
            partnership strategy (CPS) and the FY07 CPS progress report.
            The FY04 CPS was a key step in establishing a framework for
            a closer partnership between Costa Rica and the Bank
            following a nearly decade-long period of extremely limited
            engagement. The CPS program was relevantly built around four
            pillars of the government's plan: 1) macroeconomic
            stability; 2) trade and competitiveness; 3) social progress;
            and 4) environment. Progress in implementation was slow due
            to the transition from the Pacheco to the Arias
            administration (2006) and gridlock in the Legislative
            Assembly while consensus was reached. The FY07 CPS progress
            report laid out a slightly revised CPS program based on
            requests from the new Arias administration and the program
            was extended until the end of 2007(mid-FY2008). In this
            CPSCR review, the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) rates
            the overall outcome of the Bank program as moderately
            satisfactory. Bank performance is likewise rated moderately
            satisfactory. Bank interventions were strategically
            appropriate and yielded decent outcomes in the investment
            loans that managed to go forward. The Bank's
            understanding of the political economy of reform in Costa
            Rica led to significant implementation delays or dropped
            projects. IEG concurs with the country partnership strategy
            completion report review (CPSCR) lessons, most of which
            relate in one way or another to the ways in which the Bank
            needs to engage in a country with a highly democratic
            process of achieving broad consensus. ",Country :  Costa Rica,Content Type : Reports,"August 18, 2008

Madagascar - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) for the period FY2004-FY2006 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The FY04-06 Country Assistance
            Strategy (CAS) marked a turning point in the Bank's
            relationship with Madagascar. A new leadership, apparently
            favorable towards private sector-led development and a
            stated willingness to deal with corruption issues and listen
            to the Bank's advice, was in place. The Bank aligned
            its FY04-FY06 CAS assistance with the objectives of the PRSP
            (governance, broad-based growth, and human and material
            security), and responded with larger aid volumes. During
            this CAS period, IDA credit grants amounted to US$663
            million, as compared to US$421 million during FY00-02 CAS
            period. A third of these resources were transferred through
            PRSCs. The CAS was implemented in line with plans and was
            supported by good quality AAA. IEG concurs with most of the
            lessons of the CASCR, some of which were also included in
            the 2006 CAE. An additional finding is that when scaled up,
            aid volumes can exceed the country's absorptive
            capacity and move ahead of necessary institutional reforms.
            In such cases, aid effectiveness is greatly diminished, as
            has been demonstrated by the experience of the transport
            sector and PRSCs. Also, the integration of donor-financed
            projects, such as nutrition, into the budget has been
            problematic because of institutional weaknesses and lack of
            budgetary resources. Going forward, care will need to be
            exercised in scaling up successful programs as the CASCR
            recommends. It may be advisable to predicate implementation
            of such a strategy on specific achievements in domestic
            resource mobilization and improvements in public expenditure management. ",Country :  Madagascar,Content Type : Reports,"March 19, 2007

Bulgaria - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2003-05 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The main objectives of the FY2002
            country assistance strategy (CAS) were to: (i) reduce
            poverty and raise living standards, and (ii) support
            Bulgaria's move towards European Union (EU) accession.
            These were relevant objectives in view of Bulgaria's
            need to improve incomes and living standards and the
            widespread domestic support for EU accession. The CAS to
            achieve its objectives was organized around three themes:
            (i) promoting competitive private sector-led growth, (ii)
            strengthening public administration and anticorruption
            measures, and (iii) investing in human capital and
            strengthening social protection. The CAS completion report
            (CR) concludes that the two overall objectives of the CAS
            were met. Both the CASCR and the review rated the outcome of
            the overall program as satisfactory and also the overall
            Bank performance as satisfactory. The key lessons of this
            CASCR review are that: (i) the Bank should refrain from
            pursuing lending operations which are not fully supported by
            the government; (ii) some flexibility to modify the
            non-lending program is desirable to accommodate analytical
            and advisory activities (AAA) work that may be needed for EU
            accession, but dissemination should be built into all AAA
            tasks which has not always been the case in the past; (iii)
            care should be taken not to backload any future development
            policy loans (DPLs); and (iv) a review of International
            Finance Corporation (IFC) programs should be included in a
            CASCR for countries with active IFC programs. Difficult
            policy areas, such as education and health, should be
            addressed upfront to ensure that feasible and timely

Georgia - Country assistance strategy (CAS) completion report review, Web Resource,"The 1998 Country Assistance Strategy
            (CAS) for Georgia and subsequent draft CASs focused on per
            capita income growth, poverty reduction and improved living
            standards. The original CAS FY98 objectives were, and
            continue to be, relevant. Total commitments for FY98-05 were
            US$533 million and about US$295 million for FY98-00,
            slightly below the high case lending scenario of US$320
            million. Bank assistance over the FY98 to FY05 period
            facilitated growth and macroeconomic stability but did not
            reduce poverty. Despite the Russian financial crisis of
            1998, fiscal and monetary management were conducive to
            stability and growth, partly as a result of international
            support. Control of expenditures and financial system reform
            were complemented by steadily increasing revenues, which
            rose sharply in 2004 after a new (Rose Revolution)
            government took office. Bank Group assistance was very
            effective in expanding the oil transport sector, with the
            construction of oil and gas pipeline, the fees from which
            large revenues are expected to be generated. The CASCR
            covers well the main aspects of program implementation, but
            focuses more on processes and inputs than on outcomes.
            OED's review agrees with the need to identify a few
            critical areas for good economic performance, assess
            carefully the political support for change, and concentrate
            resources in achieving meaningful outcomes. OED recommends

Uruguay - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2001-05 : OED review, Web Resource,"Operations evaluation department
            (OED) finds that the Bank assistance over the FY2001 to
            FY2005 period helped cushion the impact of Uruguay's
            financial crisis. The country assistance strategy completion
            report (CASCR) covers the CAS (May 2000), the progress
            report (July 2002), and the update (August 2002). The CAS is
            centered on three broad themes: (i) pockets of poverty and
            social exclusion; (ii) environmental and economic and
            sustainable development; and (iii) curtailing the role of
            the state via public enterprise reform and improved
            governance. These themes were supported by 12 strategic
            objectives. The original CAS objectives were relevant, but
            the crisis required an adjustment to the assistance program.
            The Bank responded flexibly and appropriately to the
            changing situation, tailoring assistance to address the
            causes and consequences of the 2002 crisis, emphasizing
            fiscal and financial sector issues, competitiveness, and
            social protection. The CAS presented nine loans totaling
            United States (U.S.) l72 million dollars, but following the
            crisis, investment projects were replaced by large
            structural adjustment loans and an emergency loan to combat
            the outbreak of hoof and mouth disease. In the end, the Bank
            committed some U.S. 620 million dollars, about four times
            more than originally anticipated. OED rates the outcome of
            Bank assistance for the period 2000-05 as satisfactory. The
            CASCR~^!!^s call for an intensified assessment of the risks
            stemming from potential regional shocks, and for contingency
            plans to deal with them, is commendable. OED recommends that

            that will improve the tracking and evaluation of results of

Bangladesh - Energy Sector Adjustment Credit Project, Web Resource,"This re-assessment report aims at
            specifically, evaluating the energy sector performance in
            policy areas covered by the adjustment credit during the
            past decade, and thus, to gauge the durability of reforms
            undertaken as part of the operation, and also, to validate
            the performance ratings established by the previous
            performance assessment report. Such ratings are now
            downgraded, showing an unsatisfactory project outcome,
            unlikely sustainability, and negligible institutional
            development impacts, accompanied by unsatisfactory Bank and
            Borrower performances. However, it is worth noting that -
            and even though private sector development was not a theme
            under this operation- important economic benefits to the
            country were recorded as a result of the big expansion in
            gas, and power production by private enterprises. The Bank
            played both a catalytic, as well as direct enabling role in
            bringing this inflow of foreign direct investment to the
            energy sector, which, by and large, is better positioned
            than a decade ago, despite major unresolved problems in its
            parastatal entities. The main lessons drawn from this
            operational reassessment suggest that: 1) selecting a Sector
            Adjustment Loan - SECAL - as the lending instrument was a
            poor choice, particularly in the case of long-gestation,
            institutional energy sector reforms, given the imperatives
            of the budgetary balance of payments to quickly disburse
            funds, and because this erodes ownership of reforms by
            implementing agencies, precisely because of lack of funding
            to them; 2) creating new entities is not a solution to the
            deep-seated problems of corporate governance, and managerial
            weakness that plague the energy sector; and, 3) the creation
            of new entities should not be fostered, unless the Bank is
            willing to commit assistance to entities evolved from
            Bank-financed reforms. ",Country :  Bangladesh,Content Type : Reports,"June 21, 2004

Hungary - Second Structural Adjustment Loan, Web Resource,"This performance audit report rates
            the Second Structural Adjustment Loan for Hungary. The audit
            rates the overall project outcome as marginally
            satisfactory, taking into account the project's mixed
            levels of achievement in macroeconomic performance,
            privatization, downsizing the budget, enhancing competition,
            and reforming the financial sector. Given the acceptance of
            policy reforms and substantial reform accomplishments of the
            new 1994-1998 government, the audit rates the project's
            achievements as fully sustainable. The audit rates the
            institutional development impact as substantial, as the
            bodies in charge of the privatization process have been
            streamlined into a single agency and a new legal framework
            for banks and enterprises has been set up. The Bank's
            performance was satisfactory in project identification and
            supervision, but less than satisfactory in appraisal;
            overall performance is therefore rated satisfactory. The
            Borrower's performance was satisfactory during
            preparation and mixed during implementation, so overall
            performance is rated satisfactory. Four key lessons emerged.
            First, the time dimension of reforms should not have been
            overlooked; within each sequence of reforms enough time
            should have been left for implementation. Second, heavy
            reliance on quota and tariff reduction were insufficient to
            ensure market liberalization, because market structures
            remained imperfect during the transition period. Third,
            macroeconomic stability was essential to achieving systemic
            transformation, particularly in an economy like
            Hungary's that was open and sensitive to foreign trade
            and financing. Fourth, partial implementation of a reform
            package did not yield satisfactory change, and resulted in
            serious structural imbalances with a public sector that
            continues to operate within a liberalized framework. ",Country :  Hungary,Content Type : Reports,"June 30, 1998

Bolivia - Third Livestock Development and Agricultural Credit Projects, Web Resource,"Agriculture produces about 25 percent

            employs more than half of the work force. One of the
            problems affecting the agricultural sector is the imbalance
            between demographic and natural resources in Bolivia's
            three main geographic regions: (i) the cold and dry
            Altiplano, which comprises 44 percent of the country's
            cultivated land and holds 56 percent of the population, (ii)
            the temperate and humid valleys, with 33 percent of
            cultivated land and 30 percent of the population, and (iii)
            the tropical lowlands with 23 percent of the cultivable land
            and 14 percent of the population. Livestock production is
            the most important agricultural activity; beef production is
            mostly concentrated in the tropical and little populated
            lowlands of the east and the Andean foothills, while sheep
            production is limited to the Altiplano, where it is part of
            the subsistence small farm system practiced by the

Bhutan - Fiscal Sustainability and Investment Climate Development Policy Credit Series, Web Resource,"This Project Performance Assessment
            Report (PPAR) evaluates a development policy credit (DPC)
            series for Bhutan consisting of the First and Second Fiscal
            Sustainability and Investment Climate Development Policy
            Credits. The program development objective was to promote
            fiscal discipline, improve access to finance for
            enterprises,1 and improve the climate for business entry and
            investment in Bhutan. Ratings are as follows: Outcome was
            moderately unsatisfactory, and Bank performance was
            moderately unsatisfactory. The experience with this DPC
            series suggests several lessons for Bhutan that may also be
            relevant to countries in similar situations: (i) DPCs should
            be more selective, focusing on fewer and better-sequenced
            reforms. Selectivity filters should include reforms that
            address critical constraints to economic growth and
            stability, those that have government and parliamentary
            support, and those for which complementary implementation
            support—including to address concerns of Parliament—is
            available. (ii) DPCs in Bhutan should have more thorough
            assessments of technical capacity and implementation risks
            and pay more attention to risk mitigation. (iii) Greater
            attention is needed to foster coordination across ministries
            and agencies. For this purpose, investment project financing
            with results-based (disbursement-linked) indicators or
            Programs-for-Results may be more efficacious instruments to
            support the achievement of objectives. (iv) DPCs in Bhutan
            that aim to address economic growth should be informed by a
            more rigorous assessment of major constraints to private
            sector development. (v) Bank Group management should
            consider what steps are feasible when legislation supported
            by development policy financing prior actions is not enacted. ",Country :  Bhutan,Content Type : Reports,"November 1, 2022

Evaluation Principles and Standards, Web Resource,"Evaluation Standards
IEG's Phase 2 Report of the Bankâs involvement in global programs recommended, among other things, that IEG should include global programs in its standard evaluation and reporting processes to the Board. This includes:

	
		Reviewing selected program-level evaluations conducted by Bank-supported global programs like IEG reviews other evaluations of Bank support at the project and country levels.
	
		Working with the Bankâs global partners to develop consensus standards for the evaluation of global programs.


	IEG is implementing both components of this recommendation concurently, since they are complementary. Each is contributing to progress on the other.
	
	
	Guidelines for Global and Regional Program Reviews
	
	IEG has developed a set of guidelines for its own Global and Regional Program Reviews (GRPRs) in consultation with the Bankâs units involved with global programs, operations policy, and trust fund management. These  guidelines â which presume the existence of a prior external evaluation commissioned by the governing body of the program being reviewed â draw upon the evaluation framework in IEG's Phase 2 Report, the three pilot GPRs which IEG completed in FY06 and the Sourcebook for Evaluating GRPPs.
	
	
	Indicative Principles and Standards for Evaluating GRPPs
	
	IEG made a presentation on this topic to the Fourth Meeting of the  OECD/DAC Network on Development Evaluation in Paris on March 31, 2006. Attended by representatives from the evaluation units of 23 bilateral agencies and development cooperation ministries, and from the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the International Finance Corporation, and the International Monetary Fund, the meeting expressed broad support for developing principles and standards for evaluating GRPPs and requested that IEG play a leading role in doing so. The Sourcebook of Indicative Principles and Standards is the result of IEG's response to this request.
	
	An earlier draft of the Sourcebook was reviewed at a Stakeholder Consultative Workshop held for this purpose in Paris on September 28-29, 2006. The workshop validated the approach of producing a free-standing and comprehensive document that presents, synthesizes, applies, and elaborates on existing evaluation principles and standards for the particular benefit of the governing bodies and management units of GRPPs. Workshop participants also provided comments that substantially improved the operational relevance of the Sourcebook and called for the additional preparation of a companion document of guidance notes and good-practice examples for the particular benefit of evaluators of GRPPs. The workshop was attended by 51 representatives (not including the workshop organizers) of the following stakeholder groups:

	
		Bilateral donor agencies
	
		UN organizations
	
		MDBs
	
		Foundations
	
		Developing countries
	
		NGOs/private sector
	
		Global programs (management)
	
		Global program evaluators
	
		Evaluation associations

 
The present version of the Sourcebook, which incorporates the feedback received at the workshop, was presented to the Fifth Meeting of the DAC Evaluation Network in Paris on November 16-17, 2006. This meeting recommended a period of practical application, use, and review, rather than formal endorsement at this stage. It encourages the governing bodies and management units of GRPPs in which DAC members are involved to draw upon them in establishing their monitoring and evaluation policies and in conducting independent evaluations of their programs on a regular basis. It further encourages those who use this Sourcebook to provide feedback to IEG and the Network based on their experience, in order to inform and further improve the document for eventual formal endorsement by Network members.

Financial Inclusion - A Foothold on the Ladder Toward Prosperity? An IEG Evaluation of World Bank Group Support for Financial Inclusion for Low-Income Households and Microenterprises (Approach Paper), PDF file,"This evaluation will assess how well the World Bank Group (WBG) has supported client countries in advancing their financial inclusion agendas, covering the fiscal years 2008 to 2013. The study will examine the role that various WBG instruments played in addressing the needs of the poor vis-à-vis inclusive access to and quality of the four key services--savings, payment, credit, and insurance. The Bank's financial literacy interventions will also be evaluated, for example, through IFC's engagements in Access to Finance and Sustainable Business Advisory Services. In addition, the study will review WBG activities with regard to fostering sound regulatory frameworks and capable institutions for ensuring growth and stability, competition, and consumer protection. IEG intends to support the WBG in leveraging its synergies across the Bank Group as well as analyzing how fully WBG operations achieved their stated objectives, and by understanding how successful inclusive finance interventions can be replicated in different country contexts. The evaluation will utilize a combination of methodologies, including (i) a comprehensive literature review, with a view to informing the Bank Group's future research agenda; (ii) country and corporate level reviews of policy and strategy documents; (iii) portfolio reviews of WBG operations and activities; and (iv) 15 country reviews, of which five will be in-depth country case studies to identify, inter alia, drivers of success or barriers to inclusiveness, and issues of complementarity, sequencing, and synergies, as well as comparative advantages of respective WBG institutions. The approach will be non-experimental, combine qualitative and quantitative methods, and draw on external and internal research data. For example, by using data from the Microfinance Information Exchange (MIX), a nonprofit organization that facilitates collection and exchange of public data designed for microfinance practitioners, IEG will seek to distill practices and observe microfinance institutions' responses to the global financial crisis and longer-term trends. In addition to stakeholder consultations during the evaluation process, IEG will implement an outreach plan at the conclusion of the study. The evaluation will be launched in relevant international fora--with the intent to maximize the study's use of findings and recommendations--addressing key stakeholders, including WBG staff, multilateral and bilateral financial institutions, donors, government authorities, and civil society organizations.

Arab Republic of Egypt : second pollution abatement project, Web Resource ,"Egypt’s rapid population growth (from 36 million in 1973 to 91.5 million in 2015), combined
with its economic development and industrialization policies and weak environmental
management, have resulted in widespread and severe pollution of Egypt’s critical air, water,
and soil resources. In recent decades, the government of Egypt has increasingly attempted to
address the pollution threats to its public health and environmental conditions, seeking support
for its efforts from international financing institutions and bilateral donors. Ratings for the Second Pollution Abatement Project in Egypt were as follows: Outcome was satisfactory, risk to development was significant, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons from the report included: (i) Though the use of concessionary financing can be effective in triggering private investments in pollution abatement, operations that rely on donor funding for such financing risk not being scaled up to the point where they can have a major impact on desired pollution outcomes, because of the inherent limitations on the availability of donor funding. (ii) The “carrot and stick” approach employed by the EPAP II model suggests that the appropriate use of financial incentives (concessionary financing) backed by potential administrative/legal threats (environmental enforcement actions) can promote industrial compliance in a country where enforcement strategies alone have been insufficient to generate compliance, especially in the early stages of tackling national pollution. (iii) The use of continuous environmental monitoring systems at industrial sites represents best practice for pollution control projects. (iv) With the uncertainties surrounding the carbon finance market, World Bank operations involving carbon finance–linked projects should undergo careful preparation, delinking implementation schedules if necessary, to avoid risks that may occur during processing. (v) Ensuring careful alignment between project objective and project design is critical to avoiding confusion in determining whether a project has achieved its goals. (vi) Managed carefully, the World Bank’s role in organizing collaboration among its development partners can significantly enhance its ability to scale up its operations in the environmental management sector. (vi) Environmental operations that rely on a credit line mechanism may be limited in their ability to target the most serious pollution issues because of requirements for creditworthiness.", ,Content Type : Reports,"March 23, 2017

"Timor-Leste - First, Second, Third Transition Support Program", Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews a series of three inter-related operations in Timor-Leste over the 2003-2005 period, in support of the countryâs Transition Support Program (TSP). These operations were part of a broader international effort in support of this new countryâs initial reconstruction and development efforts. The main objective was to provide urgently needed bridge-financing to the budget until the expected increases revenues from recently discovered and developed oil and gas became available.
IEG gives a ranking of moderately satisfactory to the overall outcome of the three projects.  Implementation experience was mixed.  Good progress was made in a few key areas, but the dire conditions that existed at the time made it difficult to make significant progress across a broad front. The main lessons drawn are: i) In instances similar following a period of conflict and devastation, the Bank should argue more strongly in favor of more focused and simpler program design, with tight priorities; ii) When there is high political risk, efforts should be directed at creating jobs and achieving âquick winsâ in poverty-related services; iii) It is probably more effective to provide Technical Assistance which is dedicated entirely to training, in parallel to advisors who actually do part of the work; iv) Particularly in countries with limited qualified personnel, it would be desirable for the Bank to focus its support around proven achievers, while seeking to develop institutional capacity; and v) The benefits of active donor coordination are often worthwhile and outweigh its costs.",Country :  Timor-Leste,Content Type : Reports,"June 30, 2008

Mali - Completion and learning review for the period FY2008-15 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review covers both Mali's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, FY08-FY11) and Interim Strategy Note (ISN, FY14-FY15). IEG rates the achievement of combined results under the CAS and the ISN as unsatisfactory. The CAS program achieved or mostly achieved improvements in the quality of the road network and airport safety; awareness of HIV/AIDS increased and preventive practices expanded; and donor coordination strengthened. During the ISN period, objectives achieved or mostly achieved included gains in access to health and education at a pilot level, improving the road network and the successful introduction of new social assistance instruments, like cash transfers, which stands out a significant shift and achievement. There have been gains in access to electricity, both during the CAS and the ISN, but these gains have come at the cost of increasing and sizeable untargeted subsidies. The main shortcomings relate to institutional reforms that did not materialize, such as the privatization of the public cotton monopoly, improving the financial situation of the public electricity company, and the reform of the budgetary process, including decentralization and procurement. Expected gains in agricultural productivity, financial viability of the public electricity company, and improved public financial management did not take place. According to IEG's validation, only 9 of 21 combined objectives in the CAS and the ISN were either achieved or mostly achieved. Five of the nine came during the ISN, signaling and improvement in performance. The bulk of objectives was either partially achieved or not achieved (12 of 21), confirming the unsatisfactory rating.",Country :  Mali,Content Type : Reports,"December 3, 2015

Mauritania - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2007-FY2012 : IEG review, Web Resource,"This review examines the implementation of the FY2008 to FY2011 Mauritania Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of FY2007, and assesses the CAS Completion Report (CASCR). The CAS was implemented by International Development Association (IDA). The overarching objective of the CAS was to contribute to poverty reduction through the different channels of its interventions in Mauritania. The CAS objectives were organized under the five pillars as Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)- 2: (i) accelerate growth and maintain macroeconomic stability by strengthening the macro-economic framework, private or financial sector and competitiveness, growth potential in key sectors, and infrastructure; (ii) anchor growth in the economic environment of the poor through the development of rural and urban sectors, micro-finance, and Micro and Small Enterprise (MSE), and targeted poverty alleviation programs; (iii) develop human resources and generalize access to basic social services via improved access to education and vocational, technical training, health and nutrition, water and sanitation, basic services, and increased rights awareness; (iv) improve good governance and capacity building through modernization of public administration, efficient management of public property, and decentralization; and (v) reinforce pilot programs, monitoring, evaluation, and coordination. Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) rates the overall outcome of Bank assistance as unsatisfactory, below the CASCR rating of moderately unsatisfactory. The Bank played an insignificant role and or achieved little progress in the areas of a modern business environment, tools for managing the fishery sector, rural electrification, land tenure reforms, maternal health services, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) treatment, and gender equality.

Guinea - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) and interim strategy note completion report (ISNCR) review for the period FY2004-FY2013 : IEG review, Web Resource,"This review examines the
            implementation of the FY2004 to FY2006 Guinea country
            assistance strategy (CAS) of FY2003 and the FY2011 to FY2012
            interim strategy note (ISN) of FY2011, and assesses the CAS
            and ISN completion report (CASCR). The CAS was prepared for
            International Development Association (IDA) only, whereas
            the ISN was for IDA, International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). This
            review covers, the activities of the three institutions,
            although the CASCR does not discuss IFC or MIGA programs.
            The overall objective of the CAS was to support the
            implementation of the three pillars of the 2002 poverty
            reduction strategy paper (PRSP). The ISN had as its overall
            goal to deliver timely and adequate support to the newly
            elected government in its effort to bring about a tangible
            improvement of the living conditions of the population. The
            overall CAS and ISN objectives were relevant to the country
            context and aligned with the PRSP priorities. Independent
            Evaluation Group (IEG) agreed with the lessons drawn in the
            CASCR, and underscores three additional points. First, for
            both accountability and learning purposes, it is important
            that country strategies and completion reports adhere to the
            World Bank Group (WBG) norms for setting and reporting on
            monitorable objectives. Second, given the gap between IEG
            ratings on completed projects and the much higher
            implementation status result (ISR) ratings on projects under
            implementation, the Bank will need to pay careful attention
            to these projects in order to recognize the downside risks
            and provide necessary implementation support. Third, the
            experience with this country program highlights the
            importance of having a real strategy, underpinned by sound
            analyses of the political economy, in a fragile and

Bhutan - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY2006-09 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The FY2006-09 Bhutan country
            assistance strategy (CAS) was a joint strategy of
            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
            and International Finance Corporation (IFC). This review
            evaluates the CAS and its implementation, and evaluates the
            CAS completion report (CR). This CAS aimed to contribute to
            Bhutan's development by addressing priorities under
            three main pillars and three cross-cutting themes. The
            pillars aimed at: (i) expanding access to improved
            infrastructure and social services and connect communities
            to markets; (ii) enhancing private sector development and
            employment; and (iii) scaling up the management of public
            resources and the monitoring and evaluation (M and E)
            instruments to gauge development outcomes. The three
            cross-cutting themes were good governance, decentralization,
            and environmental management. Bhutan's development
            strategy maximizes gross national happiness, a concept that
            brings together cultural, social, environmental, and
            economic concerns; the World Bank Group's (WBG)
            strategy focused on economic growth by opening up the
            economy and the country, and integrating it within a
            regional and global setting with a more active private
            sector and foreign investment. Bhutan made considerable
            progress during these years in terms of economic growth, due
            to significant increase of hydropower exports. It also made
            progress in many of the areas supported by the WBG, which
            gave effective budget support to Bhutan in the midst of the
            world financial crisis. However, there were shortcomings in
            the delivery of parts of the program. Accordingly, the
            outcome of the WBG's support to Bhutan was rated
            moderately satisfactory. The key finding of this review is
            that the ownership of the WBG program supporting Bhutan can
            have been higher had the strategy been more aligned with
            Bhutan's own development approach, which has a
            different understanding of economic growth. ",Country :  Bhutan,Content Type : Reports,"November 23, 2010

Serbia - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) for the period FY2005-FY2007 : IEG review, Web Resource,"The FY05 Country Assistance Strategy
            (CAS) sought to support the government's development
            priorities for FY05-FY07, defined by two pillars: European
            Integration and poverty reduction. The CAS program supported
            these objectives through programs aimed at: (a) creating a
            smaller, more sustainable, more efficient public sector; (b)
            creating a larger, more dynamic, private sector; and (c)
            reducing poverty levels and improving social protection and
            access to public services. IEG rates the overall outcome as
            moderately satisfactory. IEG concurs with the CASCR that
            progress toward objectives (b) and (c) has been satisfactory
            for the most part but rates progress toward the first
            objective as moderately unsatisfactory because of the
            limited fiscal consolidation and short-term improvement in
            the effectiveness and efficiency of the pension system.
            While IEG sees merit in the flexibility with which the
            lending program was maintained, it rates Bank performance as
            moderately satisfactory due to shortcomings in assessing
            political economy realities and gearing the program towards
            the key constraints for accession to the EU. A number of
            external developments, including better than expected
            privatization revenues, allowed Serbia to make progress in
            poverty reduction and private sector development while not
            forcefully addressing the fundamental structural issues
            faced by the public sector. Looking forward, the CASCR
            identifies a number of lessons and IEG is in general
            agreement with these lessons while noting the importance of
            (i) the Bank being selective, strategic and explicit about
            the criteria on which the selectivity is based and how
            Bank's interventions fit into the overall aid program,
            especially in the case of countries looking for EU
            accession; and (ii) a CAS results framework that is simple
            and coherent and relies mostly on significant well-defined
            indicators that can be effectively monitored. ",Country :  Serbia,Content Type : Reports,"November 30, 2007

Lao People's Democratic Republic - Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric and Social and Environment Project, Web Resource,"Ratings for the Nam Theun 2
            Hydroelectric Project are as follows: Outcome was
            satisfactory, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,
            and Quality of monitoring and evaluation was substantial.
            The NT2 HPP—given its scale, complexity, and
            significance—provides many lessons for consideration in
            future hydropower development initiatives: (i) A project
            design to capture more comprehensive development outcomes
            from hydropower, as recommended in the World Bank’s Water
            Working Note “Directions in Hydropower: Scaling Up for
            Development,” needs to balance its ambitions with the
            corresponding implementation capacity, particularly as it
            relates to experience with environmental protection and
            social development that may exceed the capabilities of many
            hydropower developers (World Bank 2009a). (ii) Strategically
            catalytic interventions, such as the NT2 HPP, can lead to
            transformational impacts when there is a commitment to and
            capacity for implementing follow-on actions such as
            replicating and mainstreaming its features. In the NT2 HPP,
            power financing through a PPP was catalytic in helping to
            develop the sector and fueling export-led growth. (iii) Bank
            Group (and other IFI) participation, including the use of
            guarantees, can be instrumental in mitigating risks and
            enhancing the private sector’s confidence to mobilize in
            nascent markets with unexploited potential and scalable
            investment opportunities. (iv) A government’s adherence to
            its commitment to implement a sound development strategy may
            be a more significant driver for achieving broader poverty
            alleviation outcomes than earmarking revenues for specific
            expenditures that are fungible within a general budget. (v)
            Hydropower can produce sizable global environmental benefits
            in terms of combating climate change, although the negative
            impacts that can arise from greenhouse gas emissions from
            storage reservoirs should also be accounted for. ", ,Content Type : Reports,"December 16, 2020

Iceland - Sigalda Hydroelectric Project, Web Resource,"This report presents the results of
            an audit of the Sigalda Hydroelectric Project for Iceland
            and is based in part on a Project Completion Report (PCR).

            also agrees with the general conclusions of the PCR. The
            project was carried out generally as designed except that
            technical improvements were made to the transmission
            component. The overall financial performance of the Borrower

            of being achieved as of the audit, but the financial
            objectives were not achieved. The audit offers three lessons

            possible. A number of hazards may have been avoided by the
            use of a Target Price and Cost-Reimbursable contract form.
            Second, in a climate of inflation coupled with a major
            development program of unusually large proportions, cash
            generation covenants may fail to ensure that a borrower
            generates funds from internal sources to keep its financial
            situation unimpaired. Third, when a corporation is not
            structurally independent of Government control and in a
            climate of inflation, financial covenants often encounter
            strong resistance from the controlling authorities.
            Financial covenants could be usefully supplemented by

            and is based in part on a Project Completion Report (PCR).
            The audit finds that the PCR's analysis is carefully

            also agrees with the general conclusions of the PCR. The
            project was carried out generally as designed except that
            technical improvements were made to the transmission

            was unsatisfactory. The utility is well-managed and its poor
            financial performance is no reflection on the ability of its
            staff. The Borrower produced excellent quality reports and
            project supervision. The physical objectives of the project
            were achieved and the institutional objectives show promise
            of being achieved as of the audit, but the financial
            objectives were not achieved. The audit offers three lessons
            learned. First, civil works, especially in unpredictable
            geological formations, present a high risk to both

            possible. A number of hazards may have been avoided by the
            use of a Target Price and Cost-Reimbursable contract form.

Turkey - Second Livestock Development Project, Web Resource,"This is a performance audit of the
            Second Livestock Development Project in Turkey, the overall
            performance of the Borrower and the bank was satisfactory.
            The project is widely perceived as successful in the Turkish
            farming community and amongst Government project planning
            and implementing agencies. The objective of bringing in
            technological inputs to the traditional farmers used to
            seasonal pasture-oriented livestock raising to increase
            yield and quality of products particularly in the highly
            potential Eastern provinces has been achieved as well as
            beef and lamb industry has been stimulated by the practical
            examples set by the project farms on the profitability of
            the gains made through scientific fattening of off-takes
            from the native as well as cross-bred stock taking advantage
            of the various agricultural by-products and crop-residues.
            The incremental incomes, financial rate of return and the
            incremental production in the project farms were
            satisfactory when compared to those projected at appraisal.
            Lessons learned: Inflation. It is advisable, in the periods
            of high inflation, to have flexibility in meeting the full
            requirements of farmers assisted, and therefore not to
            quantify in advance the number of farmers sub loans to be
            made. If the real value of the amount available for
            on-lending diminishes, or alternatively, if the project
            costs for the unit sub loans increase gradually during
            implementation-as they did in the project-it will generally
            be preferable to reduce the number of sub loans, as was done
            here, rather than to reduce the average amount per sub loan.
            Technical Estimates. In projects of this nature, and which
            aim at fattening different types of animals of different
            sex, and varying age groups, as well as increasing milk
            production, the opportunities of substituting one activity
            for another, at the farm, are numerous. Indeed, it is then
            extremely difficult to make a sensible forecast of the
            specific composition of output by animal species. ", ,Content Type : Reports,"June 23, 1981

The Project Performance Assessment Report, Web Resource,"The Project Performance Assessment Report

The Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is the field-based evaluation instrument of the World Bank Group’s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). The PPAR assesses projects financed by the World Bank for two purposes: to improve the performance of World Bank projects by identifying lessons from experience, and to ensure the integrity of the World Bank’s self-evaluation process and verify that the World Bank’s work is producing the expected results.

IEG seeks to annually conduct PPARs for 20–25 percent of the World Bank’s lending operations. The project eligible for coverage by PPAR are those whose self-evaluations (the Implementation Completion and Results Report; ICR) are submitted to IEG for Review. This includes projects submitted to the World Bank’s Board for approval (financed by the International Development Association or the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) along with certain other recipient-executed trust fund projects (generally, large Global Environment Facility projects and other recipient-executed trust funds of at least $5 million). Projects that do not submit their ICRs to IEG for review are not eligible for a PPAR.

 IEG selects projects to be covered by PPARs based on several criteria: alignment with IEG work program priorities especially through clusters of PPARs, the presence of evidence gaps in the project’s self-evaluation, the potential for learning from innovative projects, the presence of accountability issues including large financing volumes or disputed ratings, the potential for methodological innovation in evaluation, and in response to external requests from the Board or World Bank management. Projects may be covered by a PPAR at any point after project closure.

PPARs are a project evaluation, not a validation, and draw on new evidence and analysis. PPARs rely on a mixed methods approach that usually includes (but is not limited to) literature review, portfolio analysis and a country mission, involving site visits and semistructured interviews with different stakeholders. Other evaluative methods are also applied as needed.

Each draft PPAR is subject to technical peer review, internal IEG panel review, and IEG management review. Once cleared internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible World Bank Country Management Unit. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower for review. IEG incorporates both World Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers’ comments are attached to the document that is sent to the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

PPARs provide an evaluation report that produces findings and lessons on what worked, what didn’t work, and why. They also include an appendix that rates project performance on a range of criteria; these ratings follow the same methodology and definitions as do the ICR and IEG’s Implementation Completion and Results Report Review (ICRR) based on harmonized guidance between IEG and the World Bank’s Operations Policy and Country Services Vice Presidency. The PPAR project ratings are assigned based on project results at the time of completion, whereas ICR and ICRR ratings are based on project results at the time of project closure.

A complicating factor is that in 2017, ratings were reformed for investment project financing, eliminating ratings for relevance of design, risk to development outcome, and borrower performance. A further reform for development policy financing is expected in 2019–20. PPAR ratings are assigned using the same criteria as were applied to the project in its ICR and ICRR. This then generates multiple categories of ratings and definitions that are applied.

Prereform Ratings for Investment Project Financing

These ratings are applied for projects with ICRs that were initiated before July 2017.

Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which an operation’s objectives are consistent with current World Bank country strategies (expressed in Country Partnership Frameworks). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project’s design is likely to achieve the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives were achieved or are expected to be achieved. Efficiency is a measure of how economically resources and inputs are converted to results and whether the costs involved in achieving project objectives were reasonable in comparison with both the benefits and with recognized norms
Possible ratings for relevance of objectives, relevance of design, efficacy, and efficiency: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
Possible ratings for outcome: highly satisfactory, satisfactory, moderately satisfactory, moderately unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory, and highly unsatisfactory.

Risk to development outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for risk to development outcome: high, substantial, modest, negligible, and not evaluable.

Bank performance: Bank performance is defined as the extent to which services provided by the World Bank ensured quality at entry of the project and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing), toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for Bank performance: highly satisfactory, satisfactory, moderately satisfactory, moderately unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory, and highly unsatisfactory.

Borrower performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for borrower performance: highly satisfactory, satisfactory, moderately satisfactory, moderately unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory, and highly unsatisfactory.

Quality of monitoring and evaluation: The quality of monitoring and evaluation of the project is rated based on the quality of design, implementation, and use of both monitoring and evaluation.

Postreform Ratings for Investment Project Financing

Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which an operation’s objectives are consistent with current World Bank country strategies (expressed in Country Partnership Frameworks). Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives were achieved or are expected to be achieved. Efficiency is a measure of how economically resources and inputs are converted to results and whether the costs involved in achieving project objectives were reasonable in comparison with both the benefits and with recognized norms

Ratings for Development Policy Financing

Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, efficiently. The rating has two dimensions: relevance and efficacy. Relevance includes relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which an operation’s objectives are consistent with current World Bank country strategies (expressed in Country Partnership Frameworks). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project’s design is likely to achieve the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives were achieved or are expected to be achieved.
Possible ratings for relevance of objectives, relevance of design, and efficacy: high, substantial, modest, Negligible.
Possible ratings for outcome: highly satisfactory, satisfactory, moderately satisfactory, moderately unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory, and highly unsatisfactory.

Risk to development outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for risk to development outcome: high, substantial, modest, negligible, and not evaluable.

Bank performance: Bank performance is defined as the extent to which services provided by the World Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for Bank performance: highly satisfactory, satisfactory, moderately satisfactory, moderately unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory, and highly unsatisfactory.

Borrower performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for borrower performance: highly satisfactory, satisfactory, moderately satisfactory, moderately unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory, and highly unsatisfactory.

An adjustment in development policy financing ratings is expected in 2019–20.

	The WBG's Early Support to Addressing COVID-19: Economic Response (April 2020-June 2021) - An Early-Stage Evaluation (2023) - The COVID-19 pandemic caused a global economic crisis. Since March 2020, COVID-19 has put all aspects of economic and social life under immense strain. The spreading pandemic led to mandatory business closures, limitations on contact, and travel bans that contributed to a massive disruption of global economic activities. Unlike past crises (for example, the global financial crisis of 2008), the COVID-19 economic crisis did not affect just one sector; simultaneous supply and demand shocks affected numerous sectors and countries in quick succession.
	Reducing Disaster Risks from Natural Hazards: An Evaluation of the World Bank’s Support FY10-20 (2022) - Disasters caused by natural hazards are increasingly threatening the lives and livelihoods of the world’s poor and disaster-vulnerable populations. Disasters resulting from natural hazards cause billions of dollars in damages per year, and these costs are rising due to population growth, rapid and unplanned urbanization, low-quality infrastructure, and ineffective disaster risk governance. Some 82 percent of deaths since 1970 caused by natural hazards and extreme weather occurred in low- and lower-middle-income countries, where most people living in poverty reside (World Bank 2020c). Climate change is further exacerbating negative disaster impacts by contributing to more destructive and frequent droughts, floods, and storms. These disasters disproportionately affect poor populations, especially disadvantaged or vulnerable populations, who typically reside in areas with high exposure, lose larger shares of their wealth to disasters, and have limited assets and access to social networks for coping and recovery.
	Addressing Country-level Fiscal and Financial Sector Vulnerabilities - An Evaluation of the WBG's Contributions (2021) - The massive 2020 global economic crisis caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted why preparedness is so critical. Immense global public health, demand, and supply shocks hit all countries hard and at nearly the same time. The result was the deepest peacetime global economic crisis since the Great Depression. To a significant extent, the depth of the economic and social impact was a function of each country’s preexisting fiscal and financial vulnerabilities; the strength of their fiscal and financial sector policies and institutions; and the size, flexibility, and adaptability of their social safety nets.
	The IDA's Sustainable Development Finance Policy - An Early-Stage Evaluation (2021) - This report is an early-stage evaluation of the International Development Association (IDA) Sustainable Development Finance Policy (SDFP). The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) prepared the report at the request of the Committee for Development Effectiveness of the World Bank Group’s Board of Executive Directors to provide timely input to strengthen the SDFP’s effectiveness. The urgency of ensuring an effective SDFP rollout is heightened by the compounding effect on debt stress that many IDA-eligible countries face because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic’s economic impact. Its findings will also help inform discussions in the context of the 20th Replenishment of IDA.
	Building Urban Resilience - An Evaluation of the WBG's Evolving Experience (2007-17) (2019) - MORE THAN 50 PERCENT of today’s global population lives in cities. By 2030, this figure will have risen to 60 percent. The pace of urban expansion, and the transformation of land use, is staggering. An estimated 1.4 million persons move into urban areas every week. Most of this expansion—nearly 95 percent—is occurring in developing countries and will be characterized by informal and unmanaged growth (OECD 2017). Rapid, unplanned urban growth is associated with increased vulnerability, especially for the poorest and excluded parts of society, to multiple chronic stresses and acute shocks. 
	Crisis Response and Resilience to Systemic Shocks: Lessons from IEG Evaluations (2017) - During the past decade, the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluated the World Bank Group’s response to systemic shocks and its efforts to help build resilience in response to shocks such as the food crisis of 2007–08, the global financial crisis of 2008–09, natural disasters, climate change, and pandemics. These evaluations examined the response to each of these different shocks separately. This study examines the evaluations and learning products to draw general lessons from the experience that can help strengthen future support to countries’ resilience-building efforts.
	The WBG and the Global Food Crisis: An Evaluation of the WBG Response (2013) - The unanticipated spike in international food prices in 2007-08 hit many developing countries hard. The World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and International Development Association) organized rapidly for short-term support in the crisis, launching a fast-track program of loans and grants, the Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP). The GFRP mainly targeted low-income countries and provided detailed policy advice to governments and its own staff on how to respond to the crisis. The Bank also scaled up lending for agriculture and social protection to support the building of medium-term resilience to future food price shocks. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) responded by sharply increasing access to liquidity for agribusinesses and agricultural traders in the short and medium term, as well as new programs to improve incentives for agricultural market participants. This evaluation assesses the effectiveness of the World Bank Group response in addressing the short-term impacts of the food price crisis and in enhancing the resilience of countries to future shocks.
	The World Bank Group's Response to the Global Economic Crisis - Phase II (2012) - This second report of a two-phase evaluation of the World Bank Group’s unprecedented response to the 2008–09 global economic crisis addresses questions raised by the findings of the Phase I evaluation regarding the Bank’s crisis lending in the financial, fiscal, and social protection areas, and the adequacy of its lending instruments. Many findings of the Phase I evaluation are reaffirmed in this report: the unprecedented volume of the Bank Group’s response, especially to International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) countries; accelerations in processing efficiency and disbursements; the positive role, in crisis response, of well-established country dialogue and country knowledge; the greater need to balance country focus with a global strategy notwithstanding; and the Bank’s comfortable financial position at the start of the crisis, which was a key element underpinning its crisis response. Findings regarding the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) have also been reaffirmed: IFC’s largely pro-cyclical response, available financial capacity notwithstanding; its creative crisis initiatives, sometimes delayed in implementation; and MIGA’s countercyclical support to key financial institutions in Eastern Europe.
	The World Bank Group's Response to the Global Economic Crisis - Phase 1 (2010) - The global economic crisis that began in 2008 threatened to erase years of progress in developing countries. In response, the World Bank Group increased lending to unprecedented levels. The World Bank posted a large increase in middle income countries (MICs), and a much smaller one in low-income countries (LICs). The International Finance Corporation (IFC) focused on trade finance, mainly in LICs. Its new business initially fell in MICs, rebounding only in late fiscal 2010. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) concentrated on guarantees in Eastern Europe. Analytic and advisory work helped inform government and private sector responses to the crisis.
	Responding to Global Public Bads: Learning from evaluation of the WB Experience with Avian Influenza 2006-13 (2014) - Global public goods pose a key challenge to international development, as it is difficult to convince countries to undertake sufficient action when many of the benefits will accrue to the rest of the world. Working effectively across sectors is also an important challenge to development agencies and governments alike, as institutional incentives are seldom aligned to promote this type of collaboration. It is furthermore difficult for agencies like the Bank (which have the size to combat large-scale problems) to move quickly to respond to emerging crises, especially in areas in which they lack technical expertise and experience. The threat posed by avian influenza and the potential for an influenza pandemic contains elements of all of these challenges, and the efforts of the World Bank to respond to this threat offers useful lessons for a wide range of other issues that face these challenges.

"Borrow wisely, spend wisely: supporting public financial and debt management in low-income countries", Web Resource,"Sound management of public finance is critical to fiscal discipline and the efficient and effective use of scarce public resources. Weaknesses in public financial management and debt management (PFDM) can have wide-ranging implications for development, including by driving a wedge between public policy and its implementation.

A new report from IEG assesses the impact of efforts to promote sound PFDM, which is now more important than ever in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as an increasing number of low-income countries (LICs) find themselves again at high risk of, or in, debt distress.

As governments rapidly shift policy and spending in response to the pandemic, robust, responsive, and flexible PFDM systems are crucial for:


	using scarce resources efficiently to ensure value for money and prevent the unauthorized use of funds,
	accelerating budget execution and the release of critical funds to deliver essential and emergency public services, and
	managing the costs and risks associated with the inevitable short-term increase in indebtedness.


Debt Crisis, Deja vu

Even before the onset of the pandemic, a resurgence in debt stress among low-income countries (LICs) was evident, including among past recipients of large-scale debt relief. Since 2013, the number of countries eligible for financing from IDA, the World Bank Group’s fund for the world’s poorest countries,  at high risk of, or in, debt distress more than doubled (from 13 to 34) and the average debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 40% to 60% . Between 2013 and 2018, median interest payments among LICs rose 128%. And this all occurred as the Bank and others were scaling up support to debt management.

Public financial management  and debt management are often looked at separately, even though the importance of addressing them together was clearly recognized in the 19th IDA replenishment:

“the first challenge is to assist IDA countries to ensure that the benefits [of borrowed resources] exceed the costs of servicing their debt. IDA and other partners can help by supporting initiatives that enhance capacity in areas such as public finance management, public investment management … and debt management” (p 19).

Complementarity between the pillars of PFDM is at the heart of IEG’s new evaluation, World Bank Support for Public Financial and Debt Management in IDA-eligible Countries. It focuses on the decade following the 2008 global financial crisis, during which many LICs increased non-concessional and shorter-term borrowing, much of it sourced bilaterally and often on relatively opaque terms. Many LICs were also impacted by low commodity prices and the realization of large contingent liabilities, including those associated with state-owned enterprises. The period was also characterized by increasing attention to “growth enhancing” public spending and investment to close the infrastructure gap and meet the Millennium Development Goals and, subsequently, the Sustainable Development Goals.  

World Bank PFDM Support, Impactful but Uncoordinated

The evaluation found that the Bank’s support to IDA-eligible countries to strengthen PFDM led to positive, albeit limited, results. It contributed to the rollout of financial management information systems to help track and manage public expenditures but was less successful in encouraging the extension of systems to include high-value transactions. There was also an increase in the number of IDA-eligible countries that met minimum standards for several dimensions of debt management capacity, including being able to prepare Medium-Term Debt Strategies and debt sustainability analyses.

But, for many of the most vulnerable countries, debt management support was not systematically accompanied by, or coordinated with, efforts to improve public financial management, despite widely recognized synergies between borrowing, fiscal transparency, and the quality of public spending and investment. This is problematic, as many LICs were borrowing extensively from private markets and bilateral donors to finance investment projects, and thus could have benefited from improvements in institutional structures and systems to improve the quality and efficiency of public spending.

As a result, opportunities to increase the growth-enhancing impact of debt-financed public investment have likely been missed, with potentially negative consequences for debt sustainability. Public investment management (PIM) diagnostics have been undertaken by the Bank for less than half of IDA-eligible countries, with demand concentrated among higher-income LICs. Of the 32 IDA-eligible countries at high risk of, or in, debt distress in FY18, only 10 received PIM support over the previous decade. 

With the growing importance of improving the impact of scarce public resources in the face of rising debt levels, a more deliberate and coordinated approach to PFDM capacity building is warranted if the Bank is to achieve the IDA 19 objective of helping client countries ensure that debt burdens do not overwhelm their ability to reduce poverty or provide essential government functions. The decentralized and uncoordinated way PFDM diagnostics have been undertaken and used in the Bank suggests that there is scope to realize further synergies among PFDM pillars.

A Way Forward

The evaluation recommends that Bank staff maintain a clear and up-to-date picture of PFDM strengths and weaknesses for each IDA-eligible country, drawing on existing assessments of the main dimensions of PFDM. This has already been addressed within pillars of PFDM, but synergies across pillars remain underexploited.

It also recommends that the Bank more systematically support PFDM in IDA-eligible countries with better sequenced and complementary lending and nonlending support. Implementation of the new Sustainable Development Finance Policy and the associated identification of performance and policy actions provide an early opportunity to take a more holistic view of PFDM at the country level. In the wake of the economic shock associated with the pandemic, efforts to maintain a broader focus on both borrowing and spending will only increase in importance.

Mozambique - Decentralized Planning and Finance Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews the Mozambique Decentralized Planning and Financing Project (2004 to 2009). Its objective was to improve the institutional performance of Mozambique's District Administrations to plan and manage small infrastructure investments in response to community demands, through (i) improving local government resource management capacity; and (ii) doing so in a participatory and transparent manner. On the first aspect, provincial budget transfers to districts were established, and some financial statements were audited. Annual performance evaluations of implementation of local investment grants found that the target of good or excellent performance was exceeded in many cases. The project helped provide prior conditions for, though did not directly support, a new intergovernmental transfer system for unconditional block grants based on defined criteria, which provided added opportunities for the learning-by-doing approach to capacity development. On the second aspect, the project did well to help set up an institutional framework for transparent district planning and management. This process of community participation within a deconcentrated framework was a politically feasible step towards improved accountability. All districts were covered, with broad representation. Key administrative and fiscal instruments combined with planning and monitoring by District Consultative Councils helped to support transparency and accountability. Evidence showed that citizens were satisfied with the participatory process, and the accountability it provided. One overall issue was the absence of a decentralization policy framework. The overall outcome of the project was Satisfactory. Lessons include, (i) A learning-by-doing approach can be effective for countries at an early stage in the decentralization process, whereby its focus is on solving locally-determined and locally-defined problems, as well as encouraging experimentation and experiential learning, and engaging a broad set of agents so that development efforts are viable, legitimate, relevant and supportable. A well-designed monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework can help to inform the work of planning and finance units; (ii) In settings without elected subnational authorities, a process of controlled or limited participation within a deconcentrated framework can be politically feasible, and help to ensure accountability and efficient use of resources; and (iii) While managing small scale, public infrastructure investments is useful for building subnational administrative capacity, managing lines of credit that are poorly regulated and vulnerable to manipulation, can weaken legitimacy and good will built up through participatory processes.

Four Lessons from the Sahel on Land Restoration Programs and their Impact on Vulnerable Populations , Web Resource,"World Bank Group support to developing countries to manage their natural resources is critical for poverty reduction. A recent IEG evaluation assessed how well the World Bank has addressed natural resource degradation to reduce the vulnerabilities of resource-dependent people. On Desertification and Drought Day, we present the following four lessons drawn from IEG's assessment of World Bank support for the Great Green Wall.

Decades ago, several African Heads of State envisioned, and eventually lent their support to, the development of a Great Green Wall: a large belt of trees that stretches across twelve states of the Sahel. The concept of the Great Green Wall was developed to combat land degradation and desertification of the Sahel, a concept that has grown in importance as the threats posed by climate change intensify. Twenty-one African countries have signed on to the initiative, along with at least 11 international partners; including the African Union, European Union, and the World Bank.   

These are four key lessons that can inform future investments in the Great Green Wall:  

1. A precise understanding of the change in vegetation cover across the Sahel, attributable to donor investments in the Great Green Wall, has been limited because of an underinvestment in measurement.

Earth observations combined with site observations show that the World Bank’s support for the Great Green Wall has been successful. Vegetation has been successfully established, land has been rehabilitated, and the density of trees and shrubs have increased dramatically at rehabilitation sites. However, projects did not implement measurement mechanisms to establish how much of the increase of vegetation can be attributed to donor programs versus other important variables including changing rainfall.  

Watch: Discussion on the role of increased rainfall on the greening of the Sahel and the need for sustainable practices with professor Matt Turner, from the Department of Geology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Oumarou Moumouni, member of the development NGO Groupe de Recherche, d'Etudes d'Action pour le Développement in Niger. 

{""preview_thumbnail"":""/sites/default/files/Data/styles/video_embed_wysiwyg_preview/public/video_thumbnails/9D0oF2fUcu4.jpg?itok=BZuE1M4A"",""video_url"":""https://youtu.be/9D0oF2fUcu4"",""settings"":{""responsive"":0,""width"":""854"",""height"":""480"",""autoplay"":0},""settings_summary"":[""Embedded Video (854x480).""]}

2. Land management practices that seek to restore degraded land can run the risk of exacerbating vulnerability. 

Just prior to the coronavirus pandemic, there were 30 million food insecure people in the Sahel. This large cohort consists of farmers, agro-pastoral, and nomadic populations – all of whom engage in traditional land-use arrangements that provide mutual food and livelihood benefits. In these settings, even the most degraded land has value: these are important areas of passage and grazing for livestock, particularly during the rainy season, and are sources of wild plants and wood gathered by women. But the use of area enclosures – a land management practice that seeks to restore degraded land by excluding livestock and humans from openly accessing it in the short to medium term – runs the risk of exacerbating vulnerability; and in the absence of good land governance, possibly causing harm 

Watch: IEG’s evaluation analyst Joy Butscher explains some of the impacts of land management practices on pastoral populations.  

{""preview_thumbnail"":""/sites/default/files/Data/styles/video_embed_wysiwyg_preview/public/video_thumbnails/n_vBYKCnMkA.jpg?itok=hb5_7ceT"",""video_url"":""https://youtu.be/n_vBYKCnMkA"",""settings"":{""responsive"":0,""width"":""854"",""height"":""480"",""autoplay"":0},""settings_summary"":[""Embedded Video (854x480).""]}

3. Increasing the value of degraded land can lead to predation by elites and to encroachment by non-traditional farmers, which risks displacing the local population.  

Such was the case in Niger, where land was effectively restored, but where parcels were also sold outside of the community, in areas that lacked good land governance. Predation also occurs as a result of decisions to support crop agriculture alongside tree planting. While land restoration activities took place on communal land, the introduction of “inter cropping” facilitated individualized claims on community land. Projects should be designed with an understanding of customary, flexible tenure arrangements and the coping strategies of vulnerable resource users who access degraded lands as a social safety net.  Importantly, that emphasis should be placed on ensuring that clear, enforceable land-use agreements are in place prior to land restoration activities, to protect the land-use rights of the most vulnerable. 

Watch: Professor Matt Turner, from the Department of Geology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, on land governance in Niger.

 4. Because land restoration mainly benefits those that have access to land, some women and youth are especially disadvantaged in the Sahel.  

In Niger, a very large number of women are forced to fend for themselves and their families because their husbands and sons have migrated to other West African countries to look for work. Projects that support land and resource restoration can ensure that women and youth benefit by addressing participation barriers, linked to social and cultural norms. For example, since in some conservative areas, some women’s participation in cash for work programs is prohibited, programs must propose alternative income generating options to ensure equity. 

Watch: Oumou Moumouni, from the UN Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs speaks of the disadvantages women face in the Sahel.

What Difference Does a Better Bank Make?, Web Resource,"In his reminiscences on the origins of independent evaluation, Mervyn Weiner, the first to hold the title Director General of an independent evaluation unit, describes a Board meeting in the early 1970s. This was a period of major transformation as the World Bank shifted away from large infrastructure projects to focus on poverty. The Board was discussing a proposed program of investments in agriculture and rural development, when an Executive Director asked how they would know if the projects were worthwhile after they had been implemented.

On July 1, 1973, then World Bank president Robert McNamara announced a refinement to the nascent evaluation function that had been established three years earlier, creating a wholly independent unit, the Operations Evaluation Department (OED). The sole focus of the unit, the antecedent to the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), would be to evaluate completed projects to provide an objective assessment of their development effectiveness, contribute to learning from experience, and as an earlier circular noted, ‘give us a degree of conviction about the impact of what we are doing which we could obtain in no other way.’

Establishing an accountability and learning ecosystem

The independence of the evaluation function was a significant innovation aimed at insulating it from influence and guaranteeing its objectivity. It has since become the model for evaluation functions at development organizations of all types. At the time, the decision was part of a broader move toward laying the foundations for an accountability ecosystem designed to answer key questions about World Bank performance and results. This also included the gradual formalization of systems of self-evaluation.

One year after the establishment of OED, a monitoring and evaluation unit was created within the Agriculture and Rural Development Department, the first of its kind. Today, every World Bank project and every country program undergo a process of self-evaluation at completion, which is then validated by IEG. This combination of self-evaluation and independent evaluation is now understood to be an essential feature of effective corporate governance, and a key characteristic of an open and accountable institution.

Looking at the bigger picture

While not the only element, independent evaluation has played a vital role within this dynamic. It has helped shift the focus from outputs to outcomes, broaden the scope of assessments to account for the combined effects of lending and non-lending activities, and to look beyond projects to understand the overall impact on the development of client countries. To provide an ever more detailed and complete picture of the results of World Bank activities, the focus of independent evaluation has also steadily expanded to include corporate policies and strategies, and their contribution to development effectiveness.

This last fiscal year alone, as part of its varied work program, IEG has completed evaluations of the early responses to the health and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, IFC Additionality in middle-income countries, World Bank use of the Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Framework, and the country programs for Morocco and Mozambique. Along with providing an objective basis for assessing progress, these evaluations were timed to inform decision making and the design of future policies, programs, and strategies.

Systems for feedback, follow up, and country ownership

In tandem with the evolution of independent evaluation, processes have been established to institutionalize the way in which lessons and recommendations from evaluations are discussed, committed to, and followed up on. Discussions of IEG reports at the Board’s Committee on Development Effectiveness provide a platform for the Board, World Bank management and IEG to reflect on findings and their related recommendations, and how they might guide future directions and contribute to better outcomes for client countries.

This process is complemented by the Management Action Record, an annual report that spells out the progress achieved on IEG recommendations. The preparation of the report provides another platform for discussions among operational teams across the World Bank on the lessons derived from past performance and how they can be integrated to improve development effectiveness. These processes are testaments to the World Bank’s commitment to accountability for results and constant learning from experience.

From its very beginning, the independent evaluation function has also focused on helping client countries establish similar processes of their own. For the very same reasons that the World Bank has invested in them, the aim has been to support countries in building the necessary capacities for evaluation as vital for effective governance, policies informed by evidence, and the monitoring of progress towards development goals. In 2020, IEG joined with partners to launch the Global Evaluation Initiative to meet the growing demand for evaluation capacity development.

Adapting evaluation for the new World Bank playbook

As the World Bank now prepares to adapt to meet new challenges, its shareholders, including both governments and people, can be confident that well developed and transparent systems exist to gather evidence from the past to inform decisions on the way forward, track progress toward objectives, and adapt to changing circumstances as needed. Yet while independent evaluation emerged during a period of transformation and has become a central feature of the accountability and learning ecosystem, it has also adapted constantly to address new questions and meet new needs.

IEG will celebrate its fiftieth anniversary with a series of discussions on the evolution of independent evaluation and how it might now adapt to support the development of the new World Bank playbook.  New approaches will be needed to assess progress toward Global Public Goods, while maintaining a steady focus on the development goals of country clients. With overlapping crises threatening to derail progress, support for building client country capacities for decisions informed by evidence will become increasingly important.

Save the date for a first event on September 14 in the Preston Auditorium! We look forward to your thoughts on harnessing the lessons from the past to inform future directions.

Bulgaria - Registration and Cadastre Project, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews the experience and lessons of the Bulgaria Registration and Cadastre Project (RCP) in the Republic of Bulgaria. The project was approved in June 2001, and received an IBRD Loan of EURO 33.5 million ($30.0 million equivalent at the prevailing exchange rate). The project was restructured in May, 2006, accompanied by a cancellation of $4.8 million of the Loan and a one-year extension of the project period to install an information technology system. A further extension of one year was granted in 2008, to complete the information technology system. The project closed in March, 2009, two years beyond the original closing date.
The objective of the project was to improve the coverage, completeness, accuracy and responsiveness of the real property and cadastre registration systems, thus contributing to the development of the real property market. The Project Appraisal Document also refers to securing tenure of real property to boost investments in housing, agriculture, commerce, manufacturing and services, and to the requirements of EU accession.
Overall the project was rated satsifactory.  The project achieved its objectives: coverage exceeded targets, some 28 cadastral offices were established and 113 registration offices in the courts were upgraded and equipped, providing an accessible network covering the country. In addition, staff in the field offices and at headquarters were trained. Risk to development outcome is rated moderate as the registration and cadastre agencies are now established and experienced institutions and clients value and are prepared to pay for their services. However, self-sufficiency would be further assured if the two agencies merge thus enabling registration services to provide financial support to the less profitable cadastre activities. The performances of the Bank and Borrower were both satisfactory.",Country :  Bulgaria,Content Type : Reports,"June 29, 2010

Algeria - Mortgage Finance Technical Assistance Project and Morocco - Housing Sector Development Policy Loan and National Slum Upgrading Projects, Web Resource ,"This is a Cluster Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) of Bank assistance to the housing sector in Algeria and Morocco. Strong macroeconomic performance by both countries during the 2003-2008 period covered by these operations helped move housing sector reform forward. Both are pursuing housing sector reform, with strong public sector participation still, especially in Algeria. 
In this PPAR, IEG pilots an evaluation of the Slum Upgrading PSIA that provided advice to the Ministry of Housing and Planning (MHU) about the responsiveness of VSB to bidonvillois, slum residents, and the modalities of housing provision to them. IEG rates the Algeria Mortgage TA Project's objective to help strengthen the basis for a well functioning
mortgage market as substantially relevant. The project design was relevant too, especially for a small operation, in focusing upon a few key necessary conditions that could seed housing reform. The Morocco Housing DPL had two substantially relevant objectives. The design
of the operation was also substantially relevant in identifying key prior actions that could help achieve the objectives. The overall outcome of the Housing DPL is rated moderately satisfactory.", ,Content Type : Reports,"June 29, 2010

"Lithuania - Klaipeda Port Project, and Poland - Szczecin-Swinoujscie Seaway and Port Modernization Project", Web Resource ,"This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for two seaport projects: the Klaipeda Port Project in Lithuania and the Szczecin-Swinoujscie Seaway and Port Modernization Project in Poland. Both projects had similar content, combining substantial rehabilitation of major marine infrastructures under public responsibility with support for leadership by the new port authorities in attracting and extending private initiative in provision of the services required within the port.
The overall outcome of the Lithuanian project is rated moderately satisfactory and that of the Polish project moderately unsatisfactory, with the shortfalls from fully satisfactory due in each case to lags and uncertainties in securing full benefits expected. In respect of purpose and design both projects remained substantially relevant to the countries' evolving needs. Design, implementation and utilization of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) show striking contrasts, between the substantial performance at Klaipeda (Lithuania) and negligible achievement at Szczecin-Swinoujscie (Poland). The contrasts appear to have stemmed from differences in initial effort. World Bank performance is rated satisfactory for the Klaipeda project (Lithuania), but moderately unsatisfactory for the Szczecin-Swinoujscie project (Poland). Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory in both countries.", ,Content Type : Reports,"June 17, 2010

Lesotho - Country assistance strategy completion report (CASCR) for the period FY2006-FY2009 : IEG review, Web Resource,"This CASCR review evaluates the
            FY06-FY09 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Lesotho.
            This strategy pertained only to IDA and is evaluated by
            IEG-WB. No CAS Progress report was prepared. While the
            beginning of this CAS period was marked by high GDP growth
            and large fiscal surpluses, adverse economic shocks were
            anticipated. The deterioration in Lesotho's growth and
            fiscal position was expected to exacerbate key challenges
            faced by the country (very high poverty and inequality
            levels despite growth, and the world's third-highest
            HIV/AIDS prevalence) and to further question the efficiency
            and equity of a dominant public sector. Total lending
            reached US$79 million over the CAS period (FY06-09). The
            Bank program was partially implemented: five out of the
            eight planned credits were approved and five out of the 11
            planned pieces of economic and sector work were delivered.
            Out of the three projects closed during the CAS
            implementation period, IEG rated two moderately satisfactory
            and one moderately unsatisfactory. The assistance achieved
            most of the outcomes sought under the HIV/AIDS pillar
            (HIV/AIDS), albeit with important shortcomings. The outcome
            of Bank support was poor on the other three pillars,
            sustainable pro-poor growth and job creation, human
            development, and public service delivery through government
            reform IEG rates the overall outcome of World Bank
            assistance as moderately unsatisfactory. One lesson from the
            experience of Bank assistance to Lesotho is that it is
            difficult to design effective shared growth and employment
            programs in the absence of an in-depth understanding of
            underlying redistribution mechanisms. Furthermore, where
            capacity constraints are severe, improving capacity within
            projects (through project-specific technical assistance) is
            neither sufficient to achieve national outcomes, nor is it
            sustainable. Improvements in M&E must be integrated with
            national systems. ",Country :  Lesotho,Content Type : Reports,"June 3, 2010

Haïti - Projet de Développement Dans le Nord, Web Resource,"This is a performance audit of the
            Rural Development Project in the Northern Department of
            Haiti. The audit finds that the PCR covers adequately the
            project's salient features, and the audit memorandum
            generally agrees with its conclusions. In addition to
            summarizing the objectives and outcome of the project, the
            memorandum devotes special attention to three issues which
            are seen in numerous rural development projects:
            insufficient preparation, an error of judgment regarding the
            time needed to exert a significant impact on agricultural
            production, and a project organization which, from the
            outset, did not meet the requirements of integrated regional
            development. As such ratings for the Rural Development
            Project of Haiti were as follows: outcomes were moderately
            satisfactory; the risk to development was substantial; the
            Bank’s performance was moderately satisfactory; and
            the Borrower’s performance was reasonably
            satisfactory. Considering the complexity of the agricultural
            sector, lack of sufficient Knowledge on socioeconomic
            aspects, and the fact that the project was the first IDA
            involvement in agriculture in Haiti, the project proved to
            be a good learning experience. (a) The major lesson has been
            the need for flexibility and active participation in
            adjustment and redesign by supervision missions. Without
            substantial changes in organization and scope of components,
            the project would have experienced greater difficulties. (b)
            At the same time, a critical review or issues by supervision
            missions was required before changes were made, considering
            that the Northern Department Development Agency (ODN)
            occasionally proposed changes that could not be justified.
            (c) Projects of this type in Haiti require a commitment of
            sufficient and continuing local manpower to ensure frequent
            supervision. (d) Experience suggests that the main risk in
            this project (and probably in the follow-up project) was
            institutional uncertainty. This results from a lack of
            continuity in staffing, policies and programs, and from
            uncertainty of funding. (e) IDA and the Government learned
            the importance of the availability of viable technical
            packages and the role of regional development. ",Country :  Haiti,Content Type : Reports,"June 28, 2005

Myanmar – Completion and Learning Report : IEG Review, Web Resource ,"This review of the World Bank Group’s (WBG) Completion and Learning Review (CLR) covers the period of the Country Partnership Framework (CPF), FY15-FY17, and updated in the Performance and Learning Review (PLR) dated June 2, 2017, which extended the CPF period by two years to FY19. This CPF followed the end-2012 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) that resumed WBG operations after a hiatus of about 25 years. To support the Government’s development efforts, the WBG implemented a major expansion of its activities (a seven-fold increase in the Bank’s portfolio), possibly beyond what the country could absorb. Nevertheless, this support contributed to good progress on farming productivity; on access to electricity, telecommunications, health, education, and finance; and on the business climate. IEG agrees with the lessons drawn by the CLR. These are reformulated and summarized as follows: (i) In an environment of constrained implementation capacity, projects with diverse objectives and multiple implementing agencies may become unwieldy and lead to delays in project implementation. (ii) A results framework that excludes the program’s cross-cutting issues will impede assessment of success in addressing these issues. (iii) Use of country systems, support of key reform champions, and joint analytical work are among the factors that build trust with counterparts and stakeholders. (iv) Access to and coordination of trust fund resources will encourage effective implementation and collaboration across development partners. (v) Good and timely data is critical for evidence-based policy dialogue and timely response to country developments. (vi) A “one WBG” approach is critical to leverage WBG instruments toward specific objectives such as access to electricity. Seventh, more careful attention to indicators, including their sources, baselines, targets and time frames will facilitate program monitoring. (vii) A “disconnect’ between written implementation rules and actual practices in Myanmar, e.g., on procurement, may cause implementation delays. IEG adds the following lesson: Joint Implementation Plans (JIPs5) can improve the effectiveness of the “one WBG” approach noted by the CLR lessons. WBG CPFs normally intend collaboration across the Bank, IFC, and MIGA, but more often than not, CPFs do not spell out how such collaboration is to happen. Myanmar’s CPF JIP to improve access to electricity helped ensure that joint work would materialize. IEG rates the CPF development outcome as Moderately Satisfactory and WBG performance as Good.",Country :  Myanmar,Content Type : Reports,"May 6, 2020

India - Rajasthan Power Sector Restructuring Project, Web Resource ,"This performance assessment report evaluates the Rajasthan Power Sector Restructuring project. The project was intended to support the restructuring and reform of the power sector in Rajasthan, India. In 1999, the government of the state of Rajasthan initiated a reform program that aimed to introduce greater efficiency through competition, commercialization, market liberalization, and increased private sector participation.
In the late 1990s, India's power sector was characterized by inadequate and inefficient supply: peak capacity and energy supply shortages were estimated at 20 percent and 10 percent, respectively. In Rajasthan, the largest state in India, only 40 percent of the population had access to the power network, and operations were characterized by long service interruptions, high voltage and frequency swings, overloaded lines and substations, and commercial system losses of more than 40 percent. The project had the following development objectives: support the power sector reform process, leading to higher efficiency and financial recovery, and improve the power supply by removing bottlenecks in the distribution and transmission system. IEG selected the project for assessment because of important lessons it provides for the design and implementation of projects that support ongoing power sector reform in India.
IEG's overall project outcome rating is moderately unsatisfactory. Relevance of the objectives was substantial, but design relevance only modest; it failed to take into account political realities, and major risks were underestimated or ignored. The design itself was overambitious, and the objectives were out of proportion to the resources available. Intermediate targets proved unrealistic. Although there was a better energy supply to more customers, efficiency gains must be set against the serious failure to achieve financial equilibrium. The financial recovery objective was not achieved. IEG rated the monitoring and evaluation design and implementation as modest because of poor quality design. The key condition for long-term sustainability is the financial recovery of the sector, but there is little realistic prospect for this; thus, IEG assesses the risks to development outcome as significant.
A number of important lessons can be gleaned from this project:  (1) analyze the political economy of the reform program through local and national consultations as well as through an assessment of trends in the power sector in developing countries; (2) take into account risks to project outcomes; (3) ensure that objectives reflect a realistic judgment of the leverage accorded by investment projects on complex policy issues; and (4) monitor similar projects to ensure that project design is realistic.",Country :  India,Content Type : Reports,"March 23, 2010

Building the evidence for more effective disaster risk reduction, Web Resource,"After a long hiatus due to the COVID crises, governments will come together in Bali this week to discuss progress on the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.  Organized by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and hosted by the Government of Indonesia, the seventh session of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction comes at a crucial time: while countries struggle to address the compounded threats of food, fuel and financial insecurity in the midst of a pandemic, many must also still contend with the threat of natural hazards and the terrible costs they exact.

Almost 25 million people were internally displaced by natural hazards in 2021. Climate change is exacerbating the risks to lives and livelihoods from more severe droughts, floods, and storms. As with the shocks from the pandemic and the Ukraine crisis, it is poorer countries and their populations that are most vulnerable to the impacts of natural hazards. Building resilience to the risks posed by natural hazards remains vital for protecting people and preserving development gains and creating the conditions for sustainable development. An upcoming evaluation from the Independent Evaluation Group will offer an assessment of how and how well the World Bank has helped countries address risks of disasters caused by natural hazards.

Disaster risk reduction (DRR) is at the core of the World Bank’s approach to support green, resilient, and inclusive development, and in particular to support countries to address climate change through adaptation and resilience. The World Bank has supported hundreds of projects supporting DRR, including through physical investments in risk mitigation and resilient infrastructure, support for policy strategy and institutional reform, disaster preparedness including early warning systems, and disaster risk finance. The evaluation – scheduled to be released in October of this year ahead of the Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank Group  – seeks to identify the factors that contributed to success and failure, as lessons to build on for more effective support to countries to reduce disaster risk from natural hazards.

Underinvestment in DRR has been a global challenge. Along with a shift in mindset from disaster recovery to risk reduction, DRR requires a complex combination of building institutional capacities, the design of new policies and new investments. The evaluation undertook a series of case studies on engagements where the World Bank sought to use its upstream analytics and technical assistance, its convening power and partnerships with others, and its lending instruments to catalyze action on DRR. The goal was to zero in on the ingredients for especially effective approaches and glean lessons to guide future engagement with countries on DRR.

The evaluation also raises key questions about the extent to which the World Bank has targeted risk reduction support to the most serious hazards in each country, and the way the World Bank has influenced disaster vulnerable countries to undertake disaster risk reduction activities. The assessment also examines the way in which the World Bank’s t approaches have evolved in line with identified good practices, and how effective it has been in reducing disaster risk- including for the groups who are disproportionately vulnerable.

Understanding the effectiveness of the World Bank, or any institution’s contribution to DRR, is no small task. DRR outcomes are inherently difficult to measure because they are a reduction in the negative effects of a probabilistic future shock. Avoided losses cannot be directly measured. Reduced expected mortality and damage are a function of both the probability distribution of natural hazards of varying intensities and the effectiveness of risk reduction activities. Yet the development case for DRR has never been more vital, even as countries face a daunting array of overlapping risks.

While the upcoming evaluation looks deeply at disasters caused by natural hazards and builds the evidence for what works in motivating effective efforts to minimize their potential impacts, its findings should also be relevant for the broader and integrated efforts needed to address multiple and compound disaster risks, and support resilient development.

Tanzania - Country assistance strategy (CAS) completion report review : IEG review, Web Resource,"The FY07-10 Tanzania Country
            Assistance Strategy (CAS) was prepared as a World Bank Group
            (WBG) specific subset of a multi-donor joint assistance
            strategy, covering International Development Association
            (IDA), International Finance Corporation (IFC), and
            Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). A CAS
            Progress Report (CASPR) was prepared in 2010, dropping MIGA.
            The CASCR evaluates the outcomes of the WBG's
            assistance for the period FY07-11, focusing on IDA and IFC.
            The CAS and CASPR were well-aligned with Tanzania's
            strategies to sustain growth and reduce poverty. The two
            overarching objectives were to be pursued through progress
            in three areas, or pillars: (1) economic growth and
            reduction of income poverty; (2) improvement of quality of
            life and social well being; and (3) governance and
            accountability. The World Bank Group (WBG) program was in
            support of all three pillars. The most important findings of
            this review are as follows. First, in the face of declining
            reform efforts by Tanzania and some parallel reduction in
            the size of Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC)
            operations, there was still a significant increase in
            lending over the level planned in the CAS. While the need
            for additional support can be understood in the light of the
            effects of the global economic crisis, the increase would
            seem more warranted if it reflected improved policy
            dialogue, efforts and outcomes and not just simply a higher
            IDA allocation based on performance relative to other
            countries. Indeed, the CAS meant to adjust access to IDA
            resources based on a joint risk approach that focused on
            five risks ( political, political and economic, fiduciary,
            institutional and operational, and external) and it is not
            clear how these assessments factored in the declining reform
            efforts by Tanzania. Second, attempts at privatization and
            at private sector development fell short during this period
            as they did before; the strategy of the WBG to promote
            private sector development did not yield the desired
            results, and a better understanding of the reasons for
            failure is imperative. In this regard, IFC notes that the
            private sector identifies the lack of reliable electricity
            as the main constraint for its development. ",Country :  Tanzania,Content Type : Reports,"May 27, 2011

Jamaica - Country assistance strategy (CAS) completion report review : IEG review, Web Resource,"This CASCR Review looks at the Banks
            strategy as laid out in the FY 2005 CAS and the FY 2008 CAS
            Progress Report. Both strategy documents focused exclusively
            on the World Bank strategy, and did not cover those of MIGA
            or IFC. The 2005 CAS was based on Jamaicas Medium-Term
            Socioeconomic Policy Framework (MTF) for 2004-07. The CAS
            was designed to further the main objectives of the MTF
            around three mutually reinforcing pillarsPillar I,
            accelerating inclusive economic growth; Pillar II, improving
            human development and opportunity; and Pillar III,
            preventing and reducing crimeand two cross-cutting
            themesimproving governance and improving environmental
            sustainability. Under the first pillar, little progress was
            made to support Jamaica in the attainment of the stated
            objectives. Of the three new lending operations, only one
            went forward at a time when it could have had an impact, yet
            it was delayed in its implementation due to design flaws.
            The lack of focus on these issues is further evidenced by
            the silence of the CASCR on outcomes regarding two of the
            three components of the pillar, namely private sector
            development and rural development. Under the second pillar,
            good progress was made in the areas of HIV/AIDS prevention
            and control. In the education sector, teachers
            methodologies and diagnostic tools were developed, and two
            secondary schools were constructed. However, progress was
            limited in promoting early childhood development, and
            increasing universal enrollment at the upper secondary
            education level. With reference to the third pillar, crime
            prevention and reduction (adoption of urban intervention
            strategies likely to enhance public safety as well as to
            contribute to the reduction of the incidence of violence in
            schools), there is limited evidence that this review has
            been able to draw on regarding progress on the ground in
            achieving the objectives of Bank support. Available
            information relates for the most part to the period
            preceding Bank interventions, most notably those for
            protecting youth at risk which came towards the end of the
            CAS period. ",Country :  Jamaica,Content Type : Reports,"May 13, 2010

Building the First-Ever Partnership Focused on Addressing Global Gaps in Evaluation Capacity, Web Resource,"With the ten-year countdown to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) now underway, and countries across the globe struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, the capacity to gather data to inform decisions, and to monitor and evaluate the impact of policies, is now an urgent priority. A broad coalition of governments and national and international organizations have agreed to establish the first-ever global partnership focused on addressing the worldwide gaps in monitoring and evaluation capacity.

In June 2020, a range of donor countries and organizations met for the first time in a Co-Creation Workshop to discuss concrete steps towards establishing an inclusive partnership to meet the global demand from developing countries for stronger monitoring and evaluation systems and capacity. The aim of the partnership is to increase coordination for greater impact among the various national and international initiatives aimed at building evaluation capacity, and to pool resources and draw on local and global expertise and knowledge to scale up these efforts.

The workshop was a three-day virtual brainstorming discussion focused on building consensus around a joint vision of the global partnership. Ahead of the workshop, a series of consultations were held with representatives from countries committed to strengthening their M&E systems and capacities, to understand the challenges they face, and how best to support their programs.

{""preview_thumbnail"":""/sites/default/files/Data/styles/video_embed_wysiwyg_preview/public/video_thumbnails/ftcYucMsIlE.jpg?itok=y3Fn6dDT"",""video_url"":""https://youtu.be/ftcYucMsIlE"",""settings"":{""responsive"":0,""width"":""854"",""height"":""480"",""autoplay"":0},""settings_summary"":[""Embedded Video (854x480).""]}

Effective monitoring and evaluation systems are an essential ingredient for advancing the sustainable development goals as they foster accountability and evidence-based policy making. This innovative partnership will take us a step closer in addressing the worldwide demand from countries for stronger M&E systems and capacities for more inclusive and sustainable development results.

Oscar A. Garcia, Director, Independent Evaluation Office, UNDP

The current demand for evaluation capacity development far outstrips the resources and reach of any single institution, and the impact of the many programs launched to meet this need is diluted by a lack of coordination. Earlier this year, IEG and the UNDP’s Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) signed an agreement on closer collaboration on meeting this need. Recently, IEG also signed an agreement  with Canada’s École nationale d'administration publique (ENAP) in order to coordinate actions and pool expertise and resources towards meeting the need for stronger M&E systems and capacity in key, under-served regions of the world.

The lack of robust monitoring and evaluation systems leaves many countries at a disadvantage and has become an ever more urgent development challenge in the face of the fast-moving coronavirus pandemic. Only by working together will we be able to address the global gaps in evaluation capacity, and ensure no communities or countries are left behind.

Alison Evans, World Bank Vice President and IEG Director-General

Along with developing a joint vision, the participants in the Co-Creation Workshop also discussed the key lines of business and activities in providing countries support on strengthening their monitoring and evaluation systems and capacities. They also discussed other important aspects of the partnership, such as its operational principles, budgetary and administrative arrangements, and its governance structure. The workshop concluded with an agreement amongst the participants on key steps and actions they will be taking in collaboration with the co-hosts of the workshop - the World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) and the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  - and other partners towards launching the partnership later this year.

Keeping the private sector alive during the coronavirus (COVID-19): 4 lessons from past crises, Web Resource,"How can the World Bank Group help keep the formal private sector alive during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis?  Beyond its impact on public health, efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 are taking a toll, damaging businesses and livelihoods across the world. Trade and transport are disrupted, many businesses are idle, and workers and households have lost jobs and income.  By providing timely and effective support and financing, development agencies can help the formal private sector survive. Here’s what the World Bank Group’s experience in earlier crises tells us.  

As international financial institutions look to help the private sector cope with the economic shocks of the coronavirus pandemic, past global crises offer valuable lessons on what works.  

At the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), we have mined our evaluations of World Bank Group responses to a range of global crises, alongside assessments of programs to support the private sector, and identified four overarching lessons to guide efforts to help businesses survive the impacts of the coronavirus .

In summary, the lessons suggest a need to find ways to act fast to support the private sector, to ensure that assistance reaches those enterprises in distress, to build on prior knowledge of business conditions and constraints, and to understand that restoration of growth and employment requires a sustained response.

 1) Businesses need help quickly, so international financial institutions must act fast 

Governments are often the fastest way to get support to the private sector. The World Bank’s Development Policy Loans (DPL) provide general budget financing to governments to allow spending to address the crisis and fill crisis-induced revenue gaps.  Budget support allows governments to channel resources to banks and businesses to fund payrolls, provide guarantees, credit or loan forbearance to help firms survive although they cannot produce or sell. 

World Bank Investment Lending can get to enterprises faster when adding finance to existing loans and when designing new simple or repeater loans.

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group, which is already engaged with private banks and businesses, can respond more rapidly to keep the private sector alive when it focuses on programs and instruments that already have a solid track record and have shown the capacity for rapid mobilization during a crisis.

Following the 2008 global financial crisis, the IFC launched several new initiatives to support businesses but their set-up time and the lags in implementation limited their short-term impact.  On the other hand, IFC’s Global Trade Finance Program , an existing facility, was able to increase its support for trade finance and reach out to new banks.  New instruments may be more appropriate for the medium term.

2) Make sure projects reach the businesses that need the help

Rapid project preparation is critical during a crisis, but it is vital that projects are designed with effective systems for targeting the hardest hit firms and monitoring to ensure the help has actually reached them.

The primary aim of most crisis-related World Bank Group financial intermediary loans (FILs), was to increase bank credit for private sector groups most affected by the crisis, such as small and medium enterprises, exporters needing trade finance, rural businesses, and cooperatives.  FILS have been widely used during crisis -- including after the 2008 crisis. Subsequent evaluations found that few FILs were able to disburse rapidly, targeting was an ongoing problem for many of them and the monitoring of the impact of the crisis financing component was weak and often not reported. 

Reaching micro, small and medium enterprises poses additional challenges due to their limited size and bargaining power. Besides loans, matching grants can be helpful and business development services appear to help improve firm performance and create jobs.  Yet a better understanding of how they work and how they can be used to respond to crisis is needed. Partial credit guarantees that cover a share of the default risk of loans can also help, but their effectiveness depends on the strength of a country’s legal and regulatory frameworks.  

3)  Understanding the business environment is key to helping businesses 

Drawing from an existing stock of knowledge or carrying out new analytic and advisory work can ensure that interventions are aimed at the most important problems faced by the private sector, and that resources are directed to their best use. During the 2008 global financial crisis, earlier analytical work provided a platform for the World Bank’s response (and sometimes that of other donors as well).

In situations of fragility and conflict, Risk and Resilience Assessments (RRAs) can complement private sector diagnostics and help guide interventions that both support businesses and address the drivers of instability.

 In countries where pre-crisis engagement was low, knowledge gaps left the Bank unprepared to help map out actionable, forward-looking programs and the quality of lending suffered.

4) When the crisis is over, the private sector still needs support

Even when responding to a crisis, there is a need for longer term planning. This should be focused on an enduring restoration of growth and employment, and sustained responses.

A strategic roadmap for crisis engagement, that sequences interventions from short term to longer term can be beneficial. Such a roadmap for crisis engagement should be based on ongoing, systemic analysis of stress factors, a framework for coordination within the World Bank Group and with other international financial institutions, and a review of instruments for effective crisis support, meaningful growth and medium-term development.

What do past crises tell us about coping with the economic shocks of COVID-19 (coronavirus)? , Web Resource,"The ways in which international organizations help countries respond may define not only the future trajectory of the pandemic, but also the duration of the current economic crisis and the direction of the world’s eventual recovery. IEG has studied the responses to past crises and identifies five lessons to help both countries and the World Bank Group address the social and economic impacts of the coronavirus.  

Governments the world over face a familiar, if more urgent, issue similar to past crises: how to “flatten the curve” of economic and social decline and “steepen” the curve of subsequent economic recovery when government budgets, the private sector, and households are all under stress at the same time. Developing countries face these challenges with far fewer resources and more vulnerable populations.  

Five lessons 

For the World Bank Group to be effective in supporting client countries cope with the social and economic crises caused by the pandemic, IEG’s crisis-related evaluations suggest that it needs to pay attention to five lessons from the past: 

1. Speed and flexibility. The speed of response is of essence in these situations, as is Bank Group flexibility to adjust its programs, resources, and portfolios to support clients’ most urgent needs.  With the COVID-19 crisis unfolding much faster than the global financial crisis of 2008, this cannot be overemphasized. In fact, it appears that the Bank Group has learned this lesson: over 90 countries benefited from Bank Group support by May 1, 2020, with additional country support programs underway, barely two months after the outbreak intensified around the world. Development Policy Financing(DPF), which provides fast-disbursing budget support to client countries,  is typically the World Bank’s workhorse instrument in responding to crises because it is flexible in terms of policy focus and adaptability to different situations (e.g., standalone, programmatic, and DPF with deferred-drawdown option), and large amounts of cash can be transferred to client governments very quickly. So, it is not surprising that the Bank Group has quickly scaled up DPF support to client countries, along with other support modalities.



2. Criticality. In a crisis, there is no time to address the full range of complex reform issues that may be needed in normal times. Instead it is important to focus on the most critical issues. In this crisis, that is likely to include Bank Group interventions focused on urgent priorities with short-term impact: support for public health; budget support for social safety nets; and budgetary and financial sector support for economic recovery. This is also likely to include intensive policy dialogue and assistance to help governments shift their budgetary priorities in response to crisis needs.

3. Foresight It is not just about money. While it is critical to provide financial support and relief in the short term, it is also important to think beyond the immediate needs to recovery for the long term. That often requires focusing on select, critical policy and institutional reforms that can begin to be implemented during the crisis and extended in the recovery period to help “build back better” systems and strengthen crisis preparedness for the future. And because we now know that the world will have changed after the crisis in important ways, including how people interact, travel, work, and engage in a myriad of collective endeavors, it is important to think outside the box now on how future preparedness might look like and how it might need to differ from the past for greater effectiveness. Some countries may need to rethink their development strategies in view of these tectonic changes in the internal and external economic and social environment.

4. Focus on people – especially those in poverty. During economic crises, it is often necessary to focus on businesses and banks who are at the forefront of the economic impact, but the fact is that all crises are human crises. The COVID-19 crisis began as a public health crisis. So, focusing interventions to maximize their positive impact on the poor and vulnerable is imperative. Indeed, early Bank Group response providing urgent financing to client countries in the first two months of the crisis was concentrated on many of the poorest countries.  Given the dire warnings of hunger,  food insecurity and a rise in extreme poverty in the most vulnerable client countries, the Bank Group should be at the forefront of the fight to preserve past gains on poverty reduction and human development while working to rebuild social protection and economic systems after the crisis for more rapid recovery.

5. Coordination. The Bank Group is most effective in crises when it also coordinates effectively with its development partners. This helps the World Bank leverage its knowledge, global footprint, policy dialogue, and financial firepower with development partners on the urgent and immediate goal of helping countries cushion the impact and better prepare for recovery.  It also requires sound monitoring and evaluation based on evidence to ensure transparency and accountability. This is a clear and consistent lesson from past crises. It relates not only to collaboration with the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral agencies, but also with major donor countries, the Group of G-7 and G-20 countries (G-20), and regional development banks. On May 1, 2020, a new debt relief initiative for the poorest countries was announced. 

If the World Bank Group heeds these lessons and acts in a concerted fashion, with speed, criticality, foresight, focus on people and poverty, and coordination with partners, it will be in a strong position to help its client countries deal with and ultimately overcome the COVID-19 crisis.

Bulgaria - Country partnership strategy completion report (CPSCR) review for the period FY2007-11 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) that was issued on May 16, 2006, and was meant to cover the period July 1, 2006 through December 31, 2009. No progress report was issued and the strategy has remained in effect to date. The strategy was joint between IBRD, IFC and MIGA, and this review covers the joint program of the three agencies. 
The World Bank Group (WBG) strategy was designed with the overarching objective of facilitating Bulgaria's economic and social integration with the EU. Support was organized around three pillars, which aimed at fostering productivity and employment (Pillar I), helping the country move toward fiscal sustainability and absorb the EU funds appropriately (Pillar II), and supporting poverty reduction and social inclusion (Pillar III). Within the first broad objective, IFC was to support integration through a more efficient and sustainable financial sector, improving competitiveness of exports, and fostering public-private partnerships in infrastructure. Meanwhile MIGA was to provide insurance to foreign investors in line with the EU integration process.
With support from the WBG, Bulgaria made progress in a number of areas, most notably flexibilization of the labor market, improvement of tax administration, sustainability of the education and social security systems. At a lower level, progress was made in improving regulations on corporate governance and the water sector, and on the adoption of environmentally friendly technologies and renewable energy. WBG support did not yield good results in dealing with the transport bottleneck, with bringing in a medium-term expenditure framework, with helping Bulgaria use EU funds more intensively and better, and, especially, in the area of social inclusion.
Overall, a rating of moderately satisfactory is warranted, albeit marginally so because the support to Bulgaria seems to have not materialized in a number of areas that were considered as priorities in the CAS, while some of the interventions were not relevant enough to bring their expected outcomes. The WBG should be realistic in setting its objectives, especially when supporting areas where full country ownership is essential for their success. In addition, situations characterized by a highly uncertain environment, like the one of the forthcoming CPS, require great care in the formulation of the results framework. In light of the extended period in which the CPS remained in effect, well beyond the original time frame and into the aftermath of the global crisis, resorting to CPS Progress Reports (CPSPR) is the best way to deal with these conditions. Lastly, strategies that are joint between WB, IFC and MIGA should fully integrate IFC's and MIGA's interventions and expected results and be followed by a comprehensive reporting on activities of IFC and MIGA, in the interest of transparency.",Country :  Bulgaria,Content Type : Reports,"May 17, 2011

Thailand - Land Reform Areas Project and Second Land Titling Project, Web Resource,"The Land Reform Areas Project (Loan
            2198-TH) and the Second Land Titling Project (Loan 3254-TH)
            in Thailand took different approaches to land
            administration. The Land Reform Areas Project received
            unsatisfactory ratings in the area of development outcome,
            in light of its limited relevance to the objectives of
            sustainable land management and poverty reduction, as well
            as its poor economic rate of return. Institutional
            development impact is rated negligible because management
            and planning capacity of the implementing agency was not
            enhanced by the project. The audit rates borrower and Bank
            performance as unsatisfactory, primarily because both
            parties performed poorly during the identification and
            preparation phase, creating a project that responded weakly
            to the development needs of Thailand. The Second Land
            Titling Project received an outcome rate of satisfactory
            rather than highly satisfactory because the project failed
            to meet its original titling target. Furthermore it did not
            grapple with broader land administration issues, notably the
            unclear boundaries between private and public land. OED
            finds Bank performance and borrower performance to have been
            satisfactory rather than highly satisfactory, because
            institutional weaknesses could have been more fully
            addressed, coordination with other land administration
            agencies could have been stronger, and more provision could
            have been made for evaluating the impact of land titling on
            poverty reduction and natural resource management. The
            following lessons were gleaned from the projects: land
            titling and land reform efforts need to be grounded in an
            overall rural development strategy that weighs the relative
            cost and likely impact of various alternatives for reducing
            rural poverty and improving natural resource management; the
            success of systematic adjudication in Thailand owes much to
            circumstances that may not apply elsewhere; there is a need
            to provide farmers in the Land Reform Areas with efficient
            land surveying services leading to full (NS4) title, define
            and mark forest boundaries to enable the titling of
            contiguous lands, and share land information data more
            effectively between government agencies; and the case for
            freeing up land in state hands should be carefully considered. ",Country :  Thailand,Content Type : Reports,"June 8, 1998

How can teachers continue to grow and contribute to quality learning outcomes?, Web Resource,"The first two blogs in this series discussed the importance of good teachers and how such teachers are “made” by quality training, both before they enter the profession and while they are practicing it. The second blog specifically discussed factors that support preservice training and how these factors are reflected in projects supported by the World Bank Group.

In this final blog of the series, we look at World Bank Group assistance for in-service training, which can be vital to supplement and improve teachers’ instructional practices and knowledge. We also look at how quality can be maintained and sustained when scaling up pilot training programs, a frequent undertaking in World Bank Group projects.

The argument for supporting in-service training

Even where preservice teacher training is high-quality, in-service training is needed to ensure that teachers are up-to date with the latest in pedagogy and changes in curricula. Where preservice training is of variable quality, in-service training can be even more critical for efforts to improve learning outcomes for students.

World Bank Group task team leaders (TTLs) interviewed for IEG's recent report, Selected Drivers of Education Quality: Pre- and In-Service Teacher Training said that programs should address both preservice and in-service systems to ensure greater overall alignment. IEG’s analysis suggests that projects approved more recently are beginning to take this dual approach. This is important, because while the two systems are conceptually different, they are linked. If preservice training is inadequate, in-service training is needed to address shortcomings in teachers’ pedagogical and content knowledge.

In the second blog, we noted that intervening in preservice training can be challenging, due to sensitivities in the political economy and government reluctance to invest in this training. Perhaps for these and other reasons, the World Bank Group has engaged more often to support in-service training. In fact, 68 of the 110 projects approved under the supervision of its Education Global Practice between fiscal year 2013 and FY18 with some element of support for the professional development of teachers exclusively supported in-service training.

How World Bank Group support reflects characteristics of quality in-service training

IEG’s review of the literature found four essential features of quality in-service training: adequate duration, discipline-specific content, active and applied learning based on teachers’ needs and capacity, and follow-up support to provide opportunities for feedback and reflection.

Adequate duration. In-service training in projects supported by the World Bank Group met at least the minimum requirement for duration. Where data were available, IEG found that projects generally supported 50–60 hours of training over 5–20 days, typically at a time when students were on recess. This aligns with expected minimums for such training in the literature.

Discipline-specific content. In-service training supported by the World Bank Group tended to focus more on pedagogical training and less on subject matter training, which may be associated with the need to address shortcomings in preservice preparation. In line with findings from the literature, TTLs interviewed by IEG recognized a need for greater focus on discipline-specific content, given the often-limited capacity of teachers to teach numeracy, literacy, and science.

Active learning. Effective in-service training is characterized by a focus on teachers’ ability to foster skills such as critical thinking, communication, and collaboration. IEG’s fieldwork confirmed this broader focus in World Bank Group-supported in-service training. For example, an impact evaluation found that teacher training in fostering these skills provided under the Vietnam Escuela Nueva Project contributed to a positive effect on the socioemotional skills of children enrolled in supported schools. Consistent with TTL reports, IEG also found some training programs that embodied adult learning principles but, overall, an uneven application of learning that addressed adult learning styles, which suggests room for improvement in this area.

Follow-up support. Changes in approach demanded of teachers can be significant and are seldom simple, and teachers often start at a disadvantage due to their skill levels and gaps in their preservice training. TTLs interviewed by IEG recognized the importance of coaching/mentoring and reported that they were being encouraged to include coaching in operations. Fieldwork identified some cases where participation of teachers from the same school or grade level in training was encouraged to promote peer learning or collaborative work as part of workshops, or a cascade approach to in-service training. But this was not systematic, which suggests a need for greater commitment by all stakeholders to enhance training through more sustained follow-up.

Effective scaling-up of successful projects

The literature suggests that effective in-service training needs to reflect key features of the enabling environment (such as management, governance, and finance), and that training can be more effective when it is part of a larger reform effort and is aligned with standards and assessment and embedded in the local curriculum.

Awareness of these and other factors is particularly important when considering the scaling up of training programs. Less complex forms of scaling up that focus on enlargement or increased numbers of programs without seeking to affect systems—known as horizontal scaling—typically require fewer and less intensive conditions for success.

IEG case studies found that projects supported by the World Bank Group typically pursued horizontal scaling and have done so successfully—albeit supported by elements of local capacity that might not be equally available in less-developed countries. For example, scaling of training in Ghana under the Untrained Teachers Diploma in Basic Education project was implemented by teacher colleges and supported by improved certification requirements and data on the numbers of unqualified teachers.

However, horizontal scaling that increases the breadth of training coverage without ensuring the depth and sustainability of the training engagement is less likely to achieve long-term changes in teaching practices. Most projects explored by IEG had no plan to extend training, particularly funding, beyond the life of the project. This may be associated with the World Bank Group’s short-term, project-based funding model.

More involved, complex, and systemic scaling—known as vertical scaling—requires time and sustained attention and must be supported by influential champions and resources. Notably, the six cases of vertical training explored by IEG showed evidence that targets had been met for teachers trained in all cases, but the training was sustained by the government in only one instance.

This brings us to the end of the series, and we thank you for staying the course! The core lesson is that good teachers and good teaching underpin quality learning outcomes, which are central to any education system and critical to human development.

Evaluation Capacity Development, Web Resource,"Monitoring and Evaluation: A Closer Look


	
		
			
			The Global Evaluation Initiative 
			A global partnership to support
			evaluation capacity development 
			
		
		
			
			IEG is a proud partner of the newly-launched Global Evaluation Initiative (GEI), an inclusive global partnership committed to developing country-owned, sustainable monitoring and evaluation (M&E) frameworks and capacities to promote the use of evidence in public decision-making, enhance accountability, and achieve better results. Read more about GEI.
			
		
	



Monitoring


	Involves continuous or ongoing collection and analysis of information about implementation to review progress;
	Compares actual progress with what was planned so that adjustments can be made in implementation; and
	Is an internal activity that is the responsibility of those who manage implementation procedures, thus representing  a good management practice.


Evaluation


	Is a periodic assessment of the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and/or sustainability of an activity or intervention;
	Is a systematic search for answers about an intervention (project, program, or policy); and
	Measures the effects of an intervention and compares them with the goals and objectives of the intervention.


Evaluation Capacity Development (ECD) efforts strengthen and sustain both individuals and organizations to:


	Access, build, and implement evaluative knowledge and skills;
	Design, implement, and manage effective evaluation processes and findings; and
	Use evaluations as a performance improvement tool.


By cultivating a spirit of continual learning and capacity development, organizations are able to guide their own team members, stakeholders, and others along a more direct path to program effectiveness and accountability.  ECD also fosters the implementation of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) knowledge and practices.

M&E, an essential component of results-based management, provides information for designing, implementing, and assessing the results of government, civil society, and private sector policies, programs, and projects.  Used well, M&E can help policymakers and program managers determine what works, what is not working, and why. 

M&E in the public sector can also:


	Support evidence-based policymaking, particularly in the context of national budget cycle and national planning;  
	Guide ministries and agencies in managing activities at the sector, program, and project levels, including service delivery to beneficiaries; and
	Enhance accountability and transparency.


IEG Evaluation Methods Paper Series


The IEG Methods Papers Series offers publications on evaluation methodological research led by the IEG Methods Advisory Team, and other resources related to the promotion of evaluation knowledge. The publications are designed to provide evaluation professionals with guidance on methodological practices.

ECD Initiatives Supported by the Independent Evaluation Group


The Global Evaluation Initiative (GEI)

Globally, 91 percent of countries’ national development strategies—approved since 2015—refer to the 2030 agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); however, according to the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation, only 35 percent of them have reliable data and systems to track the progress of their policies and programs.

In response to this global gap in M&E systems and capacities, GEI is an innovative partnership that brings together a broad and diverse coalition of governments, (inter)national and local development organizations, and M&E experts to pool financial and technical resources to coordinate and expand M&E efforts globally.

The CLEAR Initiative

The CLEAR Initiative is a collaborative global program founded by academic and bilateral and multilateral institutions to support evaluation capacity strengthening in developing countries. Conceived as an innovative approach to developing the M&E capacities of governments and civil society organizations (CSOs), it is based on South-South collaboration and is backed by prestigious academic institutions recognized for their excellence in the evaluation field.

Events can take place anywhere around the world, in any language.

International Program for Development Evaluation Training (IPDET)

The International Program for Development Evaluation Training (IPDET) is an executive training program in development evaluation. IPDET is managed jointly by the University of Berne (Center for Continuing Education and Center for Development and Environment), the Center for Evaluation at Saarland University (Germany) and the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank.

The unique training program runs annually in the summer, and brings together global expertise in development evaluation in Bern, the capital of Switzerland.

IPDET strives to provide a program in which participants:


	enhance knowledge and skills of development evaluation
	learn about new topics and global trends, and
	network for collaboration and knowledge sharing.

Madagascar - Completion and learning review for country assistance strategy for the period FY07-FY13 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This Review covers both Madagascar’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, FY07-FY11) and
Interim Strategy Note (ISN, FY12-FY13). While the CAS was a joint WBG document, the ISN was
an IDA only document. The CAS implementation period was truncated due to the unconstitutional
change in regime in early 2009 and the subsequent political crisis.

Madagascar is a low-income country with a per capita income of $440 and a population of
22.9 million in 2013. Between 2002 and 2008, the economy grew at an average of 5 percent per
year. The country’s GDP contracted sharply by 4.0 percent in 2009. With the annual population
growth of 2.8 percent, Madagascar experienced consecutive years of negative GDP growth rates
per capita with -6.7% percent in 2009, followed by -2.5 percent in 2010, and -1.4 percent in 2011.
Absolute poverty in the country measured by $2 PPP per capita per day, rose from an estimated
88.9 percent in 2001 to 92.7 percent of the population in 2005, then declined slightly, but stayed
above the 90 percent mark through 2012. The Gini index for Madagascar was at 40. 6 in 2010 but

China - Phosphate Development Project, Web Resource,"The Phosphate Development Project
            (Loan 2958-CHA) in China was designed to increase the
            availability of phosphate concentrates to a dedicated
            downstream Triple Super Phosphate (TSP) plant, while timely
            and well-conceived, lost its full impact because of the
            failure by the Borrower to construct the TSP plant on time
            and the inadequate allocation of railway transportation
            capacity to carry the mines output to phosphatic fertilizer
            plants located in other provinces. This was a well-conceived
            project and achieved its basic objective of opening up a
            large open-pit phosphate mine and constructing a
            beneficiation plant and a slurry pipeline cum press
            filtration plant. The outcome of the project is rated as
            marginally satisfactory. The sustainability of this project
            is rated as uncertain. With extremely large borrowings, cost
            overruns, and accumulated losses at the end of 1997 (262
            million yuans), it faces some very daunting and intractable
            financial problems. The project's institutional
            development impact is rated as modest. The Bank performance
            is rated as marginally satisfactory because it did not
            provide the resources for effective supervision of this
            project, with the result that the coordination of the
            project implementation with that of the TSP plant was
            severed with serious consequences. The problem with the
            subsector planning model is another case of lost
            opportunity. The Borrower's performance is rated as
            unsatisfactory because of the delay in constructing the TSP
            plant and its overwhelming importance to the success of the
            project. Its greatest shortcoming was the delayed start of
            the downstream TSP plant, which has already jeopardized the
            sustainability of the Wengfu phosphate-mine development
            project. The major lesson of this project is that the Bank
            should avoid embarking on a project whose successful
            implementation would be dependent on the timely
            implementation of another project on which it has no control
            or influence. Intensive supervision, careful reporting, and
            collaboration with the Borrower to reschedule implementation
            at appropriate junctures is required. The decentralization
            reform at times has meant that pricing control has been
            devolved from the Central Government to Provincial
            Authorities. As a result the Company still has to abide by
            price guidelines which are issued by the Provincial
            Authorities, and its efforts to enter the international
            export market in order to realize a better price were
            prompted by this handicap. Finally the technical assistance
            components should be designed with sufficient flexibility as
            to eliminate the possibility of not realizing an important objective. ",Country :  China,Content Type : Reports,"June 18, 1998

World Bank Group and Guarantees: Three Questions, Web Resource,"
	Should the WBG be in the guarantee business?
Guarantee instruments have been largely effective in supporting WBG strategic objectives. Across the WBG, guarantees have effectively promoted private investment. Guarantees have supported investment flows across a broad range of high-risk sectors and countries and for small and medium-size investments. More than 30 percent of IFC guarantees have been used to support trade and investment flows in Africa.
	
	The WBG's additionality in risk mitigation derives from its relationship with governments and its contribution to broader development objectives. Each institution has issued a substantial proportion of its guarantees in high-risk countries. World Bank guarantees have helped further both policy reforms and the environment for private investment. IFC guarantees have supported financial innovation and capital market development by introducing new financial instruments to new classes of investors.
 

	Have WBG guarantees been used to their potential?
Whereas guarantee instruments remain an important tool for supporting WBG strategic priorities, the use of the instruments has fallen short of WBG expectations to varying degrees. Several factors contribute to the perception that there is significant unmet demand for WBG guarantee instruments: (1) Political risk is consistently ranked as a main constraint; (2) regulatory and contractual risks are perceived as the main reason for the growing investment gaps in infrastructure; (3) abundant liquidity in emerging markets calls for enhancements that can help deepen the market, extend maturities, lower spreads, and redirect resources to underserved market segments and new areas unfamiliar to financiers in emerging markets.
	Some external factors explain limited deployment. To some extent, the WBG has had overly optimistic expectations, particularly in the case of public-private partnerships across a range of infrastructure sectors based on rapid growth in the mid-1990s. Moreover, some studies indicate that 65 percent of investors self-insure rather than take third-party insurance, suggesting a more limited effective demand than expected. Private sector providers of risk mitigation products have expanded their coverage in terms of both products and markets. Liquid markets in the 2000s have reduced the demand for sovereign partial credit guarantees.
	
	Internal factors have also constrained the deployment of instruments. MIGAâs Convention and Operational Regulations limit its adaptability to new market trends. MIGA has also not been sufficiently aggressive in innovating within the flexibility allowed by current policies. Internal constraints to the deployment of Bank Group guarantees include the application of standards designed for public sector operations to private sector projects and lack of both internal and external promotion of the instruments. IFC has tended to apply a traditional project financierâs approach to guarantee-type instruments. It has taken an overly conservative stance toward risk-sharing facilities, which has constrained their utilization. Although some progress has been made in innovation, there has been limited replication and scaling up.
 

	Is the WBG appropriately organized to deliver the range of guarantee products?
There is an overlap in the provision of political risk mitigation (PRM) products within the WBG. Flexibility of policies and innovation in guarantee and nonguarantee products have expanded the scope for competition. In addition, several nonguarantee IFC products offer PRM to the market. The PRM products of the three WBG institutions serve the same broad group of clients, and there is evidence that these overlaps have caused confusion among clients and internal competition of the kind that often imposes additional transaction costs on clients and adds reputational risks for the Bank.
At the same time, each institutionâs products carry distinct attributes that help define market niches. Relationships of both substitutability and complementarily exist among the WBG PRM instruments, which implies both opportunities for cooperation and the need for coordination.
	
	Mechanisms to enhance coordination across the WBG have had varying degrees of effectiveness. More systematic consultations between MIGA and Bank country and sector departments have helped ensure that MIGA-supported projects are consistent with the Bank Groupâs strategy in a country. But the principles that govern the relationship between MIGA and IFC products have been unclear. In some cases, informal information sharing about business opportunities has been effective in leading to actual guarantee projects.
	
	There is limited coordination within the WBG in developing new products and at the business development stage. Lack of staff incentives, inadequate skills, and poor familiarity with the products of the other institutions has prevented better exploitation of downstream synergies in marketing WBG products. Significant potential exists for more systematic links between Bank-IFC advisory services and the use of WBG risk mitigation instruments, particularly in infrastructure, keeping in mind the need to manage potential conflict of interest issues. In sum, opportunities exist for improvement, and maintaining the status quo should not be an option.

Reducing Poverty through Sustainable Forest Use, Web Resource,"Forests are vital to human survival. About 1.3 billionâ1.6 billion people depend on forests for food, energy, timber and many other uses. But rampant deforestation has meant the loss of nearly one half of the Earthâs tropical forests cut over the past half a century. This puts pressure on policymakers, local communities and private companies to find better and more sustainable ways of using forest resources. The raging man-made forest fires in Indonesia are just one example of deteriorating conditions and their adverse effects for the country, its neighbors and the planet.
A recent learning event âManaging Forest Resources for Sustainable Developmentâ brought out relevant knowledge from the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the World Bank Group, the Asian Development Bankâs (ADB) Independent Evaluation Department and the Environment Community of Practice, and the World Resources Institute (WRI). Despite the twelve hour time difference between the participating countries, the event drew a large attendance and brought out enthusiasm around this issue.
At the event, IEG highlighted the findings from its recent evaluation of the World Bank Group Experience with Managing Forest Resources for Sustainable Development. The evaluation covers Bank Groupâs work after 2002, when it shifted the focus of its forest strategy. ""This shift allowed the Bank Group to expand its work in all forest types, establish a set of safeguards to integrate forest resource management into sustainable economic development agenda, and most importantly, strive to balance its efforts and objectives in the three critical areas of poverty alleviation, enhancement of the economic value of forests and forest conservation. Instituting this strategic change was much needed and commendable, and it is still relevant today."" â said Marvin Taylor-Dormond, Director, Private Sector Evaluations.
IEG found that participatory forest management has been the most successful at balancing the threefold goal of forest conservation, poverty alleviation, and economic development. Mexicoâs community forest management program offers an excellent example in this regard, along with positive experiences in India, Tanzania, and Albania. However, neglect of the informal sector has resulted in missed opportunities to reach more of the rural forest-dependent poor. ""In many client countries, regulations have criminalized rather than regularized the collection or production and sale of timber and non-timber forest products. Heavy fees and fines along the forest product value chainâor regulations that allow for the sale of these products to be conducted by only a licensed fewâtax the forest-dependent poor."" â said the lead author of the study, Lauren Kelly.
In protected area projects, IEG found that trade-offs still exist between conservation and poverty alleviation goals. Going forward, the projects implemented in protected areas need to do a better job of articulating how poverty alleviation will be conceptualized and incorporated into project design. In the case of industrial timber concessions, support for legal and regulatory reform has improved forest governance and enhanced transparency and accountability. The evaluation also finds that significant challenges remain with respect to revenue capture, revenue redistribution, and environmental management, among others.
Forest-related investments supported by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) have generally yielded higher value-added products and increased productivity and production capacity. âTo ensure sustainable forest management practices, however, certification of forest operations needs to be strengthened along the value chain. IFC could also have a more catalytic effect on sustainable forest management if its investments were more strategically placed.â â said Stoyan Tenev, Manager, Private Sector Evaluations.   
With the collapse of forest-related carbon markets and the failure thus far of approaches toward Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation  (REDD+) to achieve its forest-related climate change goals, IEG finds the strategy of  sustaining a âno regretsâ portfolio of forest investments that pursue adaptation and mitigation goals within the broader landscape agenda very important. At the same time, given the Bankâs leadership role in initiating and building a platform for REDD+ as well as associated market-based instruments, the World Bank Group will need to maintain a clear and direct line of communication with clients at the national and subnational levels âwhose expectations for future finance have been raised through these initiatives.
At the event, ADBâs Director General of Independent Evaluation, Vinod Thomas, highlighted the risks and opportunity in this area saying:  ""Forests are the quintessential example of gains from pursuing the triple bottom line of growth, equity and sustainability.  But we are yet to grasp this opportunity because of vested interests that stand to lose from the pursuit of such a triple bottom line.  Building on the positive examples that the IEG evaluation eloquently presents, countries and multilateral organizations need to revisit approaches to forest management for a viable way forward.""
In its evaluation, IEG recommended an expansion of support for participatory forest management (including attention to regulatory barriers), more meaningful community participation in the design and management of protected areas, and the use of improved monitoring and evaluation indicators. Certainly, building on approaches that have workedâas well as searching for innovative solutions to new challengesâwill be extremely important for sustainable forest management. In challenging environments, such as in fragile and conflict-affected states, support for industrial logging regimes or operations should be preceded by a rigorous review of the expected economic, environmental, and poverty related outcomes, including an analysis of expected outcomes under alternative land use schemes.  The evaluation also proposed the use of experience gained by IFCâs advisory services to mitigate upstream investment risks, to better attend to issues of land tenure, resource rights and competing land use claims.
Engaging local communities and the broader public in forest management issues has become easier as modern technologies become more sophisticated and accessible.  Manish Bapna, Executive Vice President and Managing Director of the WRI pointed out that âRecent advances in technology will enable us to provide near real-time, highly granular information on forest cover. This transformation in transparency will go a long way to rooting out corruption and improving the sustainable management of forests.â He presented the recently launched WRI initiative called Global Forest Watch 2.0, which was developed in partnership with Google, the University of Maryland, the UN Environment Program, and other organizations.  This work sets up a powerful near real-time forest monitoring system that brings together satellite technology, data sharing, and human networks around the world to fight deforestation, create transparency, and help promote accountability for forest management. The system uses cloud computing and open source software to rapidly process and interpret large volumes of satellite data at low cost by utilizing clusters of servers scattered around the world.
The data generated from the platform is hoped to help diverse groups of stakeholders, including governments, buyers and suppliers of sustainable commodities, media and non-profit organizations working on forest conservation. For instance, the platform is designed to be a trusted, independent, and user-friendly way to help investors in REDD+ and other forest conservation projects monitor performance and hold countries accountable to their commitments on greenhouse gas emission reductions and forest conservation. Another potential use of this data could by the media to ring the alarm bell on deforestation hotspots around the globe at a pace never-before-possible, and thereby put pressure on governments, companies, and others to curtail forest conversion and illegal logging in time.
The discussion further linked environmental sustainability with opportunities for economic growth and poverty. The urgency of finding such solutions is heightened by the role deforestation plays in augmenting the risks of climate change.

Guatemala - Country assistance strategy (CAS) completion report review : IEG review, Web Resource,"This review examines the
            implementation of the FY05-08 Country Assistance Strategy
            (CAS) and evaluates the FY07 Country Assistance Strategy
            Completion Review Report (CASCR). The FY05-08 CAS was
            closely aligned with the incoming Berger
            administration's (2004-2008) development policy. The
            CAS had four pillars: (1) strengthening fundamentals; (2)
            reducing inequality and promoting social inclusion; (3)
            stimulating growth and enhancing competitiveness; and (4)
            mainstreaming environmental concerns. Under pillar I,
            progress was made at improving macroeconomic management
            through strengthening the tax administration. The outcome
            for pillar I is rated as moderately satisfactory. Under
            pillar II, all the targets for primary education were
            reached. Delays in implementing secondary education and
            health projects resulted in no outcomes. Access to
            electricity surpassed the CAS target. Maintenance of rural
            roads increased but was below the CAS target. The outcome
            for pillar II is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. Under
            pillar Ill, Guatemala has reduced trade barriers through
            approving several trade agreements (DR-CAFTA). While this
            regional integration has led to good policies such as
            harmonization of custom duties and reductions in export and
            import restrictions. Regulatory framework in the financial
            sector improved but the existing legislation on
            conglomerates is still inadequate. The time it takes to
            register a new business decreased surpassing the revised CAS
            target. Guatemala fell in the World economic forum's
            ranking of the business climate while it improved in the
            Doing Business Indicators. The increase in the
            country's surveyed and cadastred territory was below
            the CAS target. Several activities were undertaken to
            develop public-private partnership in infrastructure;
            promote technology and innovation; and support micro, small
            and medium enterprises. Most of these interventions have yet
            to produce outcomes. The outcome for pillar III is rated as
            moderately satisfactory. Under pillar IV, an environmental
            management module and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
            system are under development but the Country Assistance
            Strategy Progress Report (CASPR) benchmarks have not been
            reached. Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) rates the
            outcome for this pillar as moderately unsatisfactory. In
            terms of the main lesson, the CASCR review stresses that a
            results based CAS needs to have rigorous outcome-oriented
            performance indicators to be effectively used in monitoring
            and evaluation. Also, a broad consensus between the congress
            and the government has to be reached before to avoid
            unnecessary delays in implementation of projects. ",Country :  Guatemala,Content Type : Reports,"September 8, 2008

Zambia - Country assistance strategy FY04-FY07 : IEG review, Web Resource,"This CASCR (Country Assistance
            Strategy Completion Report Review) examines the
            implementation of the results-based Country Assistance
            Strategy (CAS) for Zambia for FY04-FY07. The CAS supported
            the development objectives of the Government of
            Zambia's (GRZ) Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP) for
            FY02-FY04 and the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP
            2006-2010). These objectives were grouped around three
            pillars. The first pillar sustained economic growth anchored
            in a diversified export economy, had two components:
            macroeconomic stabilization and private sector development.
            The latter was supported by an International Monetary Fund
            (IMF) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and
            International Development Association (IDA's) Economic
            Management and Growth Credit (EMGCI) and Public Sector
            Capacity Building Project (PSCAP) aimed to reduce
            macroeconomic imbalances and improve financial sector
            performance. Progress was noticeable, in part due to higher
            world copper prices. However, the business environment
            remained weak and noncompetitive. IDA contribution to this
            pillar is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. The second
            pillar aimed to address problems of past growth, which had
            left behind many poor and vulnerable. IDA's
            contribution is rated moderately satisfactory. There were
            improvements in education, prevention, care and mitigation
            of population vulnerable to HIV and assistance to people in
            drought-ridden areas. In education, IDA contributed towards
            increasing gross enrollment rates for grades 1-7 and
            completion rates for grade 7. IDA was less successful
            however, in improving the overall learning achievements. IDA
            assistance supported an increase in number of females
            receiving HIV tests and the percentage of pregnant HIV
            positive women receiving complete Annual Rateable Value
            (ARVs). IDA contributions also increased access to water
            marginally in the copper belt, access to safe water
            nationally, and increased crop production in drought prone
            areas. The accomplishments of the third pillar which aimed
            to effectively and efficiently manage the public sector
            resulted in minimal progress due to the sheer difficulties
            of reform in the public sector and because of ambitious
            targets set for the pillar. Except for increased
            transparency in the budget process (through a medium term
            expenditure framework (MTEF) and activity-based budgeting
            (ABB), there is little evidence to conclude that
            sector's effectiveness and efficiency has improved over
            the CAS period since many indicators were not monitored. The
            results of IDA support in this pillar are rated as
            moderately unsatisfactory. ",Country :  Zambia,Content Type : Reports,"May 14, 2008

Brazil - Country assistance strategy FY04-FY07 : IEG review, Web Resource,"This review examines the
            implementation of the FY04-07 Brazil Country Assistance
            Strategy (CAS) and 2006 CAS progress Report and evaluates
            the 2008 Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report
            (CASCR). The Brazil CAS was one of the initial results based
            CAS pilots. The review also considers the experience and
            lessons from the detailed results framework included in the
            CAS, and of its monitoring system. This was a joint CAS with
            International Finance Corporation (IFC), but the CASCR
            focuses almost exclusively on International Bank for
            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) operations, providing
            no information on IFC's activities in Brazil. The CAS
            was aligned with and supported the objectives of the
            Government~^!!^s four-year plan (PPA) to increased equity,
            sustainability, competitiveness, and macro-economic and
            public sector performance. The CAS was highly relevant but
            too ambitious, and led to a dispersed Bank effort. The
            country outcomes and impact of Bank assistance were varied
            across the main objectives. There was substantial progress
            in poverty reduction, increased equity, and macroeconomic
            performance. The achievements in sustainability were mixed.
            Growth was sluggish, and public sector management remained a
            major challenge. Assessing the impact and contribution of
            Bank interventions proved particularly difficult in spite of
            a detailed results framework and planned monitoring
            mechanism (which was eventually not used). The difficulties
            of measuring the impact of a small Bank program in a large
            economy were compounded by the excessive breadth of the
            program, an over-elaborate results framework which often
            focused on outputs instead of outcomes, and lack of use of
            the monitoring system. The outcome of Bank support is rated
            moderately satisfactory, because of the mixed results in
            different areas. Bank performance is rated satisfactory in
            spite of some design flaws and partial implementation,
            because the Bank program and lending instruments (especially
            SWAps) evolved to adapt to changing country conditions and
            Analytical and Advisory Assistance (AAA) was of good quality
            Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) concurs with the main
            five lessons in the CASCR (the need for more focus, the
            challenge of growth in Brazil, the limitations of lending to
            Brazil when it has plenty of liquidity, the complexities of
            sub-national level work, and the difficulties of defining
            and measuring success of Bank interventions in a large
            Middle Income Country (MIC). IEG also underscores the
            importance of paying close attention to public sector
            management issues, the positive role played by SWAps in the
            Brazil program, and the need for manageable results
            frameworks and monitoring mechanisms to trace the impact of
            Bank interventions. ",Country :  Brazil,Content Type : Reports,"April 22, 2008

Mexico - Country Partnership Strategy - CPS completion report : IEG review, Web Resource,"The FY05-08 Mexico Country
            Partnership Strategy (CPS) supported implementation of
            Mexico's national development plan over that period,
            organized according to four broad thematic pillars: poverty;
            competitiveness; institutions; and environment. Recognizing
            that Mexico had a wide range of domestic and global options
            for both finance and advice, the CPS envisaged that the Bank
            Group's supporting role will be to provide flexible,
            quality, competitive in cost and quality was to be made in
            delivering both lending and non-lending support to these
            efforts primarily through the transfer of global knowledge.
            Heavy use of programmatic instruments services: Independent
            Evaluation Group (IEG) rates both overall outcome and Bank
            performance as moderately satisfactory. Outcomes for the
            poverty and competitiveness pillars are rated satisfactory
            by weighing revealed preference evidence more heavily than
            indicators on targeted outcomes. However, shortfalls in
            outcomes in the institutions and environment pillars and the
            large number of targets not achieved (particularly in the
            case of institutions) indicate respective ratings of
            moderately unsatisfactory (Institutions) and moderately
            satisfactory (Environment). Bank performance is rated
            moderately satisfactory. While the Bank's flexibility
            in adapting to Government requests is a positive factor, the
            Bank remains accountable for a program. The program, with
            better focus and a better sense of underlying demand, could
            have been closer to that which occurred, particularly in
            terms of the program proposed for institutions and the
            environment. Monitoring of the program appears to have
            fallen well short of what reasonably could have been
            expected on the basis of the monitoring framework presented
            in the CPS. Finally, the deterioration in the quality of the
            active portfolio at the end of the CPS period is of some
            concern. Going forward, it will be important to keep focused
            on contributing to substantive development results. IEG
            notes that the proposed FY08-12 operational strategy
            proposes substantial annual umbrella Development Policy
            Landings (DPLs). This support architecture thus exhibits
            many of the characteristics of general budget support.
            Evaluation and monitoring methods appropriate to this mode
            of support should be adopted as needed, as the results
            framework of the new CPS is fleshed out during
            implementation. It may be desirable to have a two tiered
            monitoring system with country and Bank indicators. As
            targets for the Bank programs are difficult to identify,
            given the small role that the Bank plays in countries such
            as Mexico, project level outcome ratings and evidence of
            impact might be the best indicators. The Bank also needs a
            better way to monitor the impact of Analytical and Advisory
            Activities (AAA). This could be done with client surveys or
            the identification of target actions or outcomes that AAA is
            supposed to inform. ",Country :  Mexico,Content Type : Reports,"March 27, 2008

Five Ways to Continue Closing Gender Gaps: Lessons from Albania and Rwanda , Web Resource,"With the COVID-19 pandemic aggravating inequalities, closing gender gaps has become ever more urgent. We look to recent evaluations of World Bank Group supported programs in Albania and Rwanda for five lessons on how to keep pushing the agenda.

The ongoing social and economic disadvantages that women around the world face, known collectively as ‘gender gaps’, has left them especially vulnerable to the many impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Women have lost jobs at higher rates, often losing out on education to become care-givers, and their already unequal decision-making power has diminished even further (World Bank, 2020 and 2021). This development calls for policy makers to act strategically to reverse the disproportionate impact of the pandemic and make progress towards reducing gender gaps, which persist despite decades of initiatives and efforts (e.g. UN, World Bank, and IDA).

The World Bank Group supports the closing of gender gaps through the implementation of its Gender Equality Strategy, which emphasizes strengthening a country-driven approach, with policy dialogue informed by better country-level diagnostics and sex-disaggregated data to achieve results. IEG’s Country Program Evaluations assess the outcomes of World Bank Group support to client governments; they often include a focus on how this support helps reduce gender gaps and advance gender-specific goals in specific countries.

Drawing from recent IEG evaluations of Albania and Rwanda, this blog highlights five general recommendations for governments and development partners seeking to make greater progress in closing gender gaps:

1. Integrate a gender perspective in Country Programs

While many country strategies mention gender issues, a gender perspective is not always well integrated. For example, the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy for Rwanda for Fiscal Years 2014–18 described gender as an overall cross-cutting issue to be pursued – however, it provided little explanation of how gender would be integrated into the Word Bank-supported program or how progress would be reported on. Other common pitfalls include (i) making gratuitous reference to gender mainstreaming without identifying clear areas of action; (ii) reporting on gender using results indicators from individual projects, rather than focusing on outcomes at a higher level e.g., the program or country level; and (iii) inconsistent treatment across sectors – it is often the case that sex-disaggregated indicators appear in education and health sector projects, but not in energy and transport sector projects (World Bank, 2016: 20-23 and World Bank, 2019).

2. Leverage analytical work to build consensus

Use analytical work to engage government authorities, citizens, and other stakeholders to articulate and build support and consensus for reforms. In Albania, in-depth analytical work undertaken by World Bank staff helped diagnose gender inequities, and inform the articulation of policy options to address vulnerabilities and gender disparities in a range of areas including labor force participation rates and wages, shortcomings in agency and property rights for women, and significant levels of domestic violence. In Rwanda, several gender-focused analytical products, including ones from the Adolescent Girls Initiative, informed World Bank-supported country strategies and operations.

3. Push most difficult reforms to remove legal and regulatory constraints

In Albania, despite recent improvements, legal and regulatory constraints, combined with implementation gaps, still hinder economic opportunities for women. To address the significant gender gap in land ownership, in 2019, the World Bank Group encouraged inclusive land and property registration and policy reforms through the first gender-focused Development Policy Financing Operation. Some of the reforms supported included increasing registration of women as co-owners of properties and improving regulation that allows women to use property to access financing.  At the same time, the Bank worked closely with bilateral donors to coordinate complementary support to build institutional capacity to support the property registration reforms.

4. Ensure data availability

While more sex disaggregated data has become available in recent years, data availability remains a challenge. In Albania, the absence of up to date household survey data makes it difficult to update analytical work, calibrate reforms, and gauge progress toward reducing gender disparities. Given the essential role of household survey data in effective project design and in advancing the gender agenda, the Bank will need to be more assertive in encouraging authorities to prioritize publication of future surveys and that these surveys are carried out regularly.

5. Monitor and evaluate using sex disaggregated indicators

It is key to include and utilize results indicators to measure progress toward gender objectives. In Rwanda, the results framework for the Bank-supported country strategy included gender-disaggregated indicators, such as the number of female-headed households benefiting from social protection programs. The Rwanda Country Program Evaluation provided some evidence that the Vision 2020 Umurenge Program[1], which the World Bank has consistently supported, has had beneficial effects on the empowerment of women by increasing their access to labor earnings and financial services, in turn enabling precautionary savings and better coping in the face of shocks.

A Way Forward

Better integrating a gender perspective, using analytical work to build consensus among stakeholders, encouraging policy reform, investing in data availability and monitoring using sex-disaggregated indicators, are five ways governments and development partners can more effectively help clients bridge gender gaps.

IEG aims to contribute to this effort through several upcoming evaluations including of Bank-supported programs in Bangladesh, Chad, and Madagascar, as well as of World Bank Group Support in Closing Gender Gaps in Countries Affected by Fragility, Conflict and Violence.

South Africa - Cape Peninsula Biodiversity Conservation Project, Web Resource ,"This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Cape Peninsula Biodiversity Conservation Project which came into force in FY 1998. The project was the first World Bank implemented GEF project in South Africa. Its objective was to ensure rehabilitation and sustainable protection of the globally significant flora, and related fauna, of the Cape Peninsula including surrounding marine ecosystems, and to initiate conservation planning and conservation activities for the entire Cape Floral Kingdom. The project substantially achieved its global environmental objective. It was instrumental in catalyzing support for the creation of Table Mountain Park and for the development of the first comprehensive conservation strategy for the entire Cape Floral Kingdom. 
IEG rated the project design as  substantial in so far as it sought to promote business opportunities for biodiversity conservation through training and employment for alien species clearing. The project supported a vast invasive alien clearing effort in and around the Park, however interviews with landowners revealed that more attention should have been paid to the methodologies chosen for clearing and a differentiated system of incentives should have been introduced for the varying categories of landowners. Overall Efficiency of the project is rated Substantial. A study commissioned by South African National Parks (SANParks) to assess the economic impact of the Park found that Park creation had a significant macroeconomic effect on Cape Town, the Western Cape, and South Africa. Both World Bank and Borrower performance were Satisfactory.",Country :  South Africa,Content Type : Reports,"January 29, 2010

South Africa - Country partnership strategy completion report (CPSCR) review for the period FY2008-12 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the FY2008-FY2012 South Africa Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of FY2008 and the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) of FY2010, and assesses the CPS Completion Report (CPSCR). The strategy was jointly implemented by IBRD, IFC and MIGA. This review covers the joint program of the three institutions.
The specific CPS objectives were organized under two pillars: (i) urban and rural development, focusing on urban and municipal development, land reform and agriculture, private sector development, environment and infrastructure; and (ii) regional integration through South African outward investment, regional communities and knowledge sharing. Improved service delivery was a cross cutting theme. The CPSPR reaffirmed the core objective of growth and equity, maintained the two pillars and the cross-cutting theme, but significantly revised the specific CPS objectives under both pillars. In particular, energy and energy efficiency were highlighted, and the focus under regional integration was shifted to improving regional investment climate and trade liberalization, and reducing HIV infection and providing treatment to all. 
IEG rates the overall outcome of the CPS program as unsatisfactory, below the CPSCR rating of moderately unsatisfactory. The World Bank Group (WBG) contributed to improved policies, systems and approaches for urban development. In the other areas, however, the gap between the expected CPS outcomes and the WBG interventions to achieve them was so significant that the CPS program had little chance to attain the CPS objectives even when the individual projects were successful. In environment, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) interventions had localized results, but lacked a catalytic impact on national conservation policy or unemployment. In private sector development, progress was made in the financial sector, but there is no information on the investment climate for labor intensive enterprises. In both rural development and climate change, the Bank's interventions were valuable, but were misaligned with the relevant CPS objectives. In infrastructure, the Bank's project was expected to produce results in the next strategy period and is experiencing delays. With respect to regional integration, the WBG activities could have been useful and/or successful, but had little influence on the expected outcomes in regional investment climate, trade liberation, HIV infection and treatment, and environmental conservation. Similarly, the Bank's assistance for building the Government's monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity was relevant and valuable for improving service delivery, but there is little evidence of discernible impact.
The CPSCR highlights a number of strengths and weaknesses of the CPS program, with which IEG agrees. Among these are the importance of providing only demand-driven support, the mobilization of highly qualified staff and consultants that have the credibility to broker knowledge and promote constructive dialogue, the weak results framework that is not anchored on reality hence not helpful in monitoring the program's implementation, and the limited synergy between IBRD and IFC. In addition, IEG underscores three points. First, more clarity is needed upfront about the risks of engagement in cases where the client is noncommittal about follow-up of the support received. Second, results frameworks need to specify clearly the linkages between inputs, outputs and results, with support activities carefully mapped to the objectives and outcomes being pursued. Finally, performance assessments need to be carried out of all economic and sector work (ESW) and technical assistance (TA) provided to a country.", ,Content Type : Reports,"October 24, 2013

Responding to Global Public Bads: Learning from Evaluation of the World Bank Experience with Avian Influenza 2006-2013, Web Resource,"Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza that spread rapidly in poultry were observed in several countries in Asia in 2003-4, and in following years spread to South Asia, Central Asia, West Asia, Africa, and Europe. The international community recognized these outbreaks as an unfolding crisis. The virus could mutate into a form transmissible between humans, triggering an influenza pandemic with severe health and economic consequences. The most effective means of preventing a pandemic was by controlling and eradicating the disease in birds and by rapidly identifying, isolating and treating infected humans - but weaknesses in veterinary services and livestock agencies meant that many countries lacked the capacity to undertake this. Filling these capacity gaps was thus a critical global public good, as reducing the risk of disease spread in one country would serve to reduce the risk in others. 

Along with governments and other international agencies, the World Bank moved rapidly to provide support through policies and analytical work, through mobilizing donor finance, and through preparing and implementing a Global Program on Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (GPAI). Under the GPAI the Bank financed 83 operations (across 63 countries) which addressed avian influenza, zoonotic diseases, or pandemic preparedness or response. The GPAI was the first global investment program supported by the Bank, and adopted two key innovations: a design template for projects and an expedited approval process. The template established a core set of activities to be supported under the emergency response projects, and the expedited approval process allowed projects to be approved by Bank management, rather than by the Board. Avian influenza projects were prepared quickly, with a median time of 4 months from concept note to approval. However, rapid preparation may have led to some weaknesses in quality at entry, and the projects were prepared no quicker than those for other emergency interventions. Still, the template system allowed a large number of emergency projects to be prepared in a relatively short period in an area in which the Bank lacked prior experience. There were inherent tensions between use of an emergency instrument with a short project life and attempts to build long term capacity through complex civil works and institutional changes. 

Combatting avian influenza requires effective collaboration between animal health and human health experts. There was a significant degree of cooperation and coordination across sectors within the Bank and in country agencies at the strategic level. However, cooperation sometimes broke down at the project implementation level, in part because of a lack of incentives for inter-sectoral collaboration within the Bank. Little operational learning and knowledge sharing occurred between Bank staff across projects during implementation, except in regions where some staff worked on multiple projects. At the country level, animal health agencies often demonstrated higher commitment and interest than human health agencies, in part because they saw avian influenza as more central to their core business. 

As the Bank lacked specific experience and technical expertise in animal health and pandemic preparedness, it worked closely with other international agencies, particularly the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Health Organization (WHO). The Bank provided financing, coordination at the country and global levels, and project supervision, while other agencies primarily provided technical support, including significant operational support from FAO and WHO. There were some tensions between the Bank and some staff in technical agencies over this division of responsibility, but it is difficult to imagine an alternative to Bank leadership, as no other agency had the capacity to finance and manage investment projects at the necessary scale. Organizational and operational coordination challenges sometimes led to implementation delays, but the overall level of cooperation between the Bank and international agencies was unprecedented, and the partnership was viewed as successful by the participants. The Bank played a key role in getting agencies to work together and in getting governments to recognize the need for action. 

Despite these achievements in preparing the GPAI, support for zoonotic disease control and pandemic preparedness has not been sustained. The Bank stopped tracking and reporting on its portfolio of avian influenza projects in 2010, and new financing for operations has largely ceased. Interest in these agendas has waned in the Bank, in client countries, in donor countries, and in other development agencies. As avian influenza and the 2009 influenza pandemic have been perceived as less serious than feared, donor priorities shifted following the global food crisis, financial crisis, and economic downturn. Yet serious risks remain, as can be seen following outbreaks of H7N9 avian influenza in China in 2013, persistence of H5N1 avian flu in about a dozen countries, and outbreaks of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) novel coronavirus since 2012. Political support for pandemic risk reduction and preparedness may be difficult to obtain without further serious outbreaks. These goals could be supported by linking them to other agendas, such as One Health, Health in All Policies, wider livestock sector interventions, and national level disaster risk management, but any of these approaches would require commitment from World Bank management and additional funding. Pandemic preparedness could benefit from following the example of the Bankâs successful shift in approach to natural disasters, moving from a responsive approach using emergency instruments to one that favors preemptive risk reduction and risk management through regular country programs and operations. 

Surveillance systems were improved in many countries, but may prove difficult to sustain in the absence of donor funds. Compensation mechanisms for culled birds have proved to be a critical element in encouraging farmers to report outbreaks and allow their birds to be culled, rather than trying to sell their sick birds and spreading disease. These mechanisms should incorporate systems for regular review of compensation rates, as otherwise the value of compensation and its effectiveness may be eroded by inflation. While many projects supported significant increases in disease diagnostic capacity, there was a tendency for projects to focus too much on investing in laboratory infrastructure and equipment rather than systems development and human capacity. Particular care is required when deciding whether to support investment in Biosecurity Level 3 laboratories, which have high maintenance costs and require significant technical capacity. The need for these facilities should be considered at a regional level, and more could be done to encourage countries to share samples, facilities, and data.

There continues to be a serious risk of influenza pandemics, but progress on managing these risks has stalled. Pandemic risk is a specific issue that requires sustained high level support and commitment to avoid being overrun by short-term priorities.", ,Content Type : Reports,"June 2, 2014

Unlocking the potential of the private sector in conflict-affected situations, Web Resource,"Up to two-thirds of the world’s extreme poor will live in conflict-affected situations (FCS) by 2030, according to World Bank Group (WBG) estimates. Advancing development outcomes in FCS is therefore central to the WBG’s mission, and the private sector is key to increasing economic growth and breaking the cycles of violence and fragility.

The 2011 World Development Report: Conflict Security and Development, and the WBG’s first Fragility, Conflict, and Violence (FCV) strategy (2020-2025) have both highlighted the critical role of the private sector in its approach to FCS. The private sector can create jobs, provide livelihoods and services, and contribute to sustainable development across multiple sectors. However, despite its potential for impact, the private sector in FCS is often informal, constrained, distorted, and may involve actors that are part of the conflict.

With a focus on unlocking this potential, supporting private investments in FCS has been a strategic priority for both the Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) for over a decade. Both institutions have committed to scaling up their activities in FCS significantly. IFC has committed to delivering 40% of its business volume in International Development Association (IDA) and FCS countries, and 15–20% in low-income IDA and IDA FCS countries by 2030. MIGA has committed to increasing the share of the volume of guarantees issued to projects in FCS and IDA countries to 30– 33% by fiscal year 2023.

What has been learned from past support for private investments in FCS?

A recent IEG evaluation assesses IFC’s and MIGA’s support for private investments and their development impact on FCS and identifies key constraining factors and possible trade-offs that investors, practitioners, and policymakers should consider. The evaluation finds that while both IFC and MIGA have gradually deployed new approaches and instruments in FCS, they have not exhibited an upward trend sufficient to achieve the targets.

This is in part the result of private businesses often being limited by insecurity, the lack of basic infrastructure—such as electricity—, weak governance and corruption, and lack of access to finance and land. These factors translate into financial and non-financial risks that deter private investors away from FCS and constrain the pipeline of bankable projects for IFC and MIGA to support. 

Evidence shows that many private investments supported by IFC and MIGA in FCS have been effective, despite the heightened risks in fragile contexts. Evaluated IFC-supported private sector investments during the 2010-2021 period performed just below investments in non-FCS environments, driven by the strong performance of projects in infrastructure, larger FCS economies, and with repeat IFC clients. And, in many instances, successful investments showed effects well beyond the projects, such as the development of local markets. 

Concentrated in traditionally well performing sectors, such as infrastructure, evaluated MIGA guarantees in FCS environments outperformed those in non-FCS. Another factor contributing to the high ratings was working with sophisticated international companies that tend to be better capitalized and have more diversified revenue sources compared to local firms (which MIGA cannot generally support).

Leveraging this performance with increasing activities in FCS remains a challenge. Under the IFC 3.0 strategy, IFC has deployed tools to support its engagement in FCS and tackle constraints to private investments in FCS. These include the blending of private and public funds to mitigate financial risks in high-risk environments, efforts to scale up upstream market creation activities to develop bankable projects, instruments to strengthen country diagnostics to better understand the intrinsic market characteristics of every country to address them more effectively, and adjusting its measuring and monitoring framework to better account for development impacts. While some of these recent instruments could bear fruit in the future, it is yet too early to assess their impact.

Early assessment of a new tool: the IDA Private Sector Window

The World Bank Group’s fund for the world’s poorest countries, IDA, launched the Private Sector Window (PSW), now the WBG’s most prominent blended finance instrument. The PSW uses non-commercial, development funds to mobilize private investments in underserved sectors and markets in FCS countries. An early IEG assessment shows that while the PSW allowed IFC and MIGA to support some projects in new markets and sectors, its usage was below expectations as the financial risk mitigation offered by the PSW is only one of the factors deterring private investments in high-risk countries. 

The private sector in low-income and fragile countries needs more than credit. 

A shortage of bankable projects that meet the IFC’s and MIGA’s standards, more so than the availability of finance, limits scaling up business in fragile contexts. Addressing this constraint warrants further shifts towards efforts to develop projects and warrants changes in the institutions’ business models. 

Factors and Trade-Offs to Consider in Scaling Up Investments in FCS

This is where efforts to scale up upstream market creation activities come into play and where trade-offs need to be considered. Recognizing the difficult landscape in FCS, IFC and MIGA should continue to review their financial risk and implications in their portfolio approach to ensure that their risk tolerance, acceptance of higher costs, and longer project gestation periods align with their strategic intentions. 

IFC and MIGA should also recalibrate further their approaches, client engagements and instruments in FCS to enhance the pipeline of bankable projects. They should take full advantage of their toolboxes to build capacity among less experienced clients and seek to expand their client base beyond those meeting IFC and MIGA standards and policies to include smaller, local, and regional firms. 

Close coordination between IFC, MIGA, and the World Bank could enhance their effectiveness in addressing weak governance, uncertainty, underdeveloped regulatory regimes, poorly functioning institutions, and other non-financial risks limiting private investments.

It is also important to recognize the heterogeneity in country characteristics and pursue differentiated strategies based on country-specific conflict analyses and diagnostics of opportunities and constraints for private investments. Furthermore, IFC and MIGA should identify metrics and targets specifically for FCS countries to focus their efforts and track progress in implementing the Bank Group’s FCV strategy.

These lessons emerging from IEG’s evaluation can guide the institutions as they advance in their commitments and unlock the full potential of the private sector.

Rwanda - Country Assistance Strategy progress report (CPSCR) and completion report (CASCR) review for the period FY09-12 : IEG review, Web Resource ,"This review examines the implementation of the FY2009-FY2013 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and the CAS Progress Report (CASPR) of FY2011. The CAS was jointly implemented by IDA, IFC and MIGA, and this review covers the joint program of the three institutions. The original CAS period was extended to FY2009 to align with the one-year extension of government's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS). The CAS sought primarily to contribute to the EDPRS objective of significantly raising growth and creating jobs. A secondary objective was to consolidate specific elements of Rwanda's recent social progress by tackling selected aspects of social vulnerability. To this end the CAS was framed around two strategic themes and five CAS objectives. Strategic Theme 1 aimed to support sustained growth by focusing on four key objectives, (i) agricultural production sustainably raised; (ii) improved access to and quality of key infrastructure services; (iii) improved environment for sound private sector development; and (iv) capacity to manage public resources strengthened at central and local levels. Strategic Theme 2 aimed (i) to attain child and maternal mortality goals; and (ii) to promote peace and social cohesion through demobilization and reintegration. IEG rates the overall outcome of WBG support as Satisfactory. Under Pillar 1, production of food crops increased, including an increase in the production of rice in targeted areas by 113 percent. Access to and quality of key infrastructure services improved, including for paved roads and electric power. The environment for private sector development improved, including in the financial sector. The primary school pupil to qualified teacher ratio was reduced, and the transition from basic education to upper secondary education was raised. The capacity to manage public resources at the central and local levels was also strengthened. Under Pillar 2, significant health and social risks to vulnerable groups and to social cohesion in Rwanda were mitigated, including with increases in assisted births in accredited health facilities, and reinsertion and/or reintegration support for former armed group members. The review agrees with the findings, conclusions, and lessons provided in the CASCR, including (i) a highly selective program helped to focus the design of the CAS in key strategic areas where the WBG would add value; (ii) use of general budget support was effective in a number of ways but is vulnerable to donor sentiments; (iii) the importance of capacity building for program design and implementation; (iv) a number of products were delivered as one WBG, and this helped create synergy within the institution and yielded benefits for the client; (v) much of project implementation support was decentralized and this could ensure a constant implementation pace; (vi) the CAS had a results framework focusing on key indicators; and (vii) stakeholder engagement is essential to enhance results and outcomes. In addition, this review would emphasize that (i) overall, Rwanda's development experience during this and the previous CAS periods, has been impressive, including rapid economic growth, improving social indicators, and declining economic inequality. IDA has made positive and constructive contributions to this substantial progress; (ii) high aid dependence as for Rwanda can represent a risk for a country's development program, and, thus, also for the success of the related Bank programs; (iii) even strong improvements in investment climate indicators may not lead to early results in terms of an investment response; and (iv) Bank program selectivity is easier when the country has clear ideas of the areas in which it wants the Bank to concentrate its support.

Scaling the Great Green Wall?, Web Resource,"As the recent One Planet Summit pivoted international attention to issues around climate and the protection of ecosystems, global leaders were eager to point to examples of successful efforts to protect and restore nature. While many efforts to stem environmental destruction have failed – and failed spectacularly – one effort, the project to plant trees across the Sahel known as the Great Green Wall, has achieved many of its envisioned technical and environmental goals. But while there is much talk of taking this successful ecosystem protection effort to scale, backed by announcements at the summit of new investments totaling US$14 billion, there is a need to learn much more about the science behind the initiative, its differentiated impacts and their costs; including the social impacts on the resource-dependent poor. Along with the achievements, there are valuable lessons to be learned about what is working and for whom that can help guide the planned scale-up.

The Great Green Wall and the World Bank

Decades ago, several African Heads of State envisioned, and eventually lent their support to, the development of a Great Green Wall: a large belt of trees that stretches across twelve states of the Sahel. The concept of the Great Green Wall was developed to combat land degradation and desertification of the Sahel, a concept that has grown in importance as the threats posed by climate change intensify. Twenty-one African countries have signed on to the initiative, along with at least 11 international partners; including the African Union, European Union, and the World Bank. The World Bank has played a contributing role over the past two decades through the Sahel and West Africa Program in Support of the Great Green Wall Initiative (SAWAP), a programmatic approach using $1.2 billion from World Bank projects and $106 million of Global Environment Facility financing “to expand sustainable land and water management in targeted landscapes and in climate vulnerable areas in twelve West African and Sahelian countries”.

The Independent Evaluation Group has evaluated a number of the projects under the SAWAP umbrella, including in Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, Niger and Togo. Some of these evaluations included site visits and extensive discussions with government counterparts and local community members to deepen understanding of the overall impact of the Great Green Wall project and Bank support for it. Our findings point to some important issues to consider when designing future projects.

The World Bank’s support for the Great Green Wall has been successful from a technical perspective. Earth observations (satellite imagery, drone footage) combined with site observations support this view. Vegetation has been successfully established, land has been rehabilitated through large commitments of labor for soil works, and the density of trees and shrubs have increased dramatically at rehabilitation sites (although observations at older rehabilitation sites suggest that these technical successes may be short-lived, due to limited funds for upkeep and necessary maintenance). Most notable amongst these positive effects is the large swaths of degraded land that have been reclaimed in critical watersheds in Ethiopia. However, a precise understanding of the change in vegetation cover across the Sahel, attributable to donor investments in the Great Green Wall, has been limited because of an underinvestment in measurement (e.g. a normalized difference vegetative index to measure the change in vegetation, recommended through a regional project by the World Bank at the beginning of the SAWAP, was never implemented). And, importantly, none of the World Bank projects estimated the effect of changing rainfall patterns on the greening effects. The misestimation of the role of rainfall variability as the key parameter affecting vegetative cover and agronomic productivity has a long history in the African drylands. Many unqualified statements have and continue to attribute Sahelian greening entirely to the actions of farmers.

But in a region grappling with food insecurity, persistent violent conflict, and rural poverty, environmental gains supported by investments in the Great Green Wall must also benefit the poor. Just prior to the coronavirus pandemic, there were 30 million food insecure people in the Sahel, and that number continues to grow. This large cohort consists of farmers, agro-pastoral, and nomadic populations – all of whom engage in traditional land-use arrangements that provide mutual food and livelihood benefits. In these settings, even the most degraded land has value: these are important areas of passage and grazing for livestock, particularly during the rainy season, and are sources of wild plants and wood gathered by women. But the use of area enclosures – a land management practice that seeks to restore degraded land by excluding livestock and humans from openly accessing it in the short to medium term – runs the risk of exacerbating vulnerability; and in the absence of good land governance, possibly causing harm. Some policymakers point to the possibility of benefits “trickling down”, but given the very moderate economic benefits of many of the SAWAP projects, that is unlikely to play out.

Increasing the value of degraded land, as was done by the Great Green Wall initiative, changes the decision-making calculation of land users – with enhanced farm value, these lands can be predated upon by elites, and can lead to encroachment by non-traditional farmers which risks displacing the local population. Such was the case in sites visited by IEG in Niger, where land was effectively restored, but where parcels were also sold outside of the community, in areas that lacked good land governance. Predation also occurs as a result of decisions to support crop agriculture alongside tree planting. While land restoration activities took place on communal land, the introduction of “inter cropping” facilitated individualized claims on community land. A lesson learned is that such projects should be designed with an understanding of customary, flexible tenure arrangements and the coping strategies of vulnerable resource users who access degraded lands as a social safety net. And, importantly, that emphasis should be placed on ensuring that clear, enforceable land-use agreements are in place prior to land restoration activities, to protect the land-use rights of the most vulnerable.

Because land restoration mainly benefits those that have access to land, some women and youth are especially disadvantaged in the Sahel. In Niger, a very large number of women are forced to fend for themselves and their families because their husbands and sons have migrated to other West African countries, such as Nigeria, Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal, to look for work. This migration is often associated with a lack of access to arable land, especially for male youth. Projects that support land and resource restoration can ensure that women and youth benefit by addressing participation barriers, linked to social and cultural norms. For example, since in some conservative areas, some women’s participation in cash for work programs is prohibited, programs must propose alternative income generating options to ensure equity.

The Great Green Wall has proved to be an effective approach to reclaiming land in a region coping with disproportionate impacts of climate change. Yet rather than delivering social benefits, the planned scale up could run the risk of increasing communal tensions without careful attention paid to unintended consequences. Evidence on the impacts of the investments on both the land and communities needs to be studied carefully as a first step to ensuring the Great Green Wall leads to equitable, inclusive and sustainable development.

Objectives of the Methods Advisory Function

IEG’s objective is to help the WBG meet its goals and enhance its development effectiveness through timely, robust evaluation. In 2016, as part of its organizational renewal, IEG’s Methods Advisory function was established to help deepen the quality and credibility of IEG evaluation work. The Methods Advisory Function currently has the following responsibilities: 


	Advising IEG staff on the best available evaluation methods to address specific evaluation questions, and how to employ those methods.
	Ensuring consistent and efficient use of data in evaluations through support to IEG’s data arrangements, systems, and analytic staffing.
	Researching, generating, and promoting innovative evaluation methodologies – within IEG and external audiences – through knowledge sharing activities and publications.
	Through a learning program, supporting the development of evaluation skills among IEG staff and ensuring that internal and external audiences understand and appreciate the rationale for IEG’s evaluation methodologies and approaches.


The Work of the Methods Advisory Function

IEG’s Methods Advisor, Jos Vaessen, in collaboration with Estelle Raimondo, Senior Evaluation Officer at IEG, lead a small team of IEG staff who have different areas of methodological specialization. These staff work together with IEG evaluation teams to achieve the objectives described above. As each evaluation is unique, there is no single approach to how the methods team members work with IEG evaluation teams. Generally, the methods team members advise on research designs and evaluation questions, recommend approaches to collect and analyze data, sometimes manage aspects of the evaluations (especially when there are methodological innovations such as employing data science approaches).  In addition to advising evaluation teams, the methods advisor and team also contribute to special evaluation initiatives in IEG or the World Bank (such as co-writing the World Bank Evaluation Principles). Researching and sharing evaluation methodological knowledge is a core part of the team’s work, and members frequently lead and organize knowledge-sharing sessions and workshops within the World Bank and with other partner groups, such as those involved with the Global Evaluation Initiative, evaluation associations, government agencies, and others. In 2020, IEG re-established its work in developing and commissioning methodological guides.   Finally, the IEG Methods Team organizes the IEG Academic Fellows program, which is on hold during the COVID-19 period but will restart when the COVID-19 situation improves.

3 lessons from past public health crises for the global  response to COVID-19 (coronavirus), Web Resource,"As the public health emergency of the novel coronavirus spreads globally, there is growing interest in how the international community can support countries’ responses to COVID-19 (coronavirus). By analyzing information from recent IEG evaluations of the World Bank Group’s response to public health crises, we identified three lesson areas that shed light on what works and where attention is needed to deliver both an immediate and a long-term response to the current crisis.

MOUNTING A RAPID RESPONSE:

Flexible financial response mechanisms are critical for providing timely support and additional funds to address the impacts of a crisis. In 2011, the International Development Association, the World Bank fund for the world’s poorest countries, created a Crisis Response Window (CRW) to deliver timely support to eligible countries faced with severe crises stemming from natural disasters, economic shocks, and public health emergencies. A 2019 evaluation revealed that about half of CRW operations used the additional financing to rapidly scale up operations that were already underway, such as a 2017 allocation to the Republic of Yemen to cope with one of the world’s worst cholera outbreaks amid continuous conflict. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Bank has established a Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility to address immediate health and economic needs in countries.  

Adapting existing operations and reacting quickly to new information can contribute to reducing project design time and to enhancing performance. The World Bank’s Avian Influenza response made use of broad project templates, which listed a wide array of options for governments to tackle the crisis. This contributed to reducing time spent on project design and approval The first phase of the COVID-19 response is organized under a flexible Multiphase Program Approach which will allow for the leveraging of existing operations and ongoing learning about the impacts of the pandemic and adapting the support to countries.

Recent experience suggests that partnerships contribute to mitigating risks related to rapid project preparation.  While this can pose challenges to ensuring project quality, evaluations of CRW operations for crises showed that partnering with UN institutions can  mitigate this risk because of the specialized knowledge they bring, and their capacity to implement projects quickly and successfully. COVID-19 operations are being prepared in less than one week, which is unprecedented in the Bank's history.

Cooperation and coalition building among countries can strengthen response performance and address longer-term needs. The Bank Group’s response to Ebola was coordinated with a coalition that helped organize the deployment of the necessary knowledge and skills across West African countries to prevent and control the spread of the disease. After Ebola, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was set up as a regional network to strengthen the continent’s public health institutions and response to disease threats and outbreaks.

CONTROLLING THE SPREAD:

Real-time monitoring of communications and public awareness programs is important to ensure their effectiveness. It cannot be taken for granted that communications campaigns aimed at key segments of the population on hygiene and control are working. Experience from the Avian Influenza suggests that assessing the impact of communications and public awareness programs on behavior is important, to understand what might be needed to achieve the desired changes. The evidence gathered can inform any necessary course corrections in the communications strategies.

Mobilization and coordination of civil society and grassroots groups is essential for effective disease monitoring, and case identification in countries. In the case of Avian influenza, weak networks between government and grassroots organizations in some countries meant that important information on cases was not reported for disease monitoring. This lack of timely and trusted access to community level information reduced the effectiveness of investments in the formal disease monitoring and surveillance platforms in some countries. In the case of Ebola, the mobilization of civil society groups was essential to communicate information on the disease and to trace contacts, with cellular phones a key tool.

Investments in technology and equipment need to be balanced with capacity building of health workers and knowledge to support laboratory diagnostics. Technical training of health workers and systems for knowledge sharing and communication may be the most important and rapid way to build laboratory capacity and scale-up disease testing. Facility and equipment upgrades have proven to be more complex, expensive, and time consuming than initially projected.

IMPLEMENTING A SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM RESPONSE:

Most World Bank operations in response to COVID-19 will go beyond the immediate emergency, creating opportunities for projects that also help countries address long-term risk reduction.

Effective logistics will be critical for both the current and future public health crises. If a vaccine or efficacious antivirus for coronavirus becomes available, purchasing it for use by health workers or other vulnerable persons could be valuable, but logistics issues are key. The Avian influenza experience show the importance of logistics management of these supplies to ensure value added use of scarce funds, and access to vulnerable persons. Antiviral drugs have a limited shelf-life and in the case of Avian influenza large stockpiles of purchases drugs went unused even during outbreaks.

The WBG and its partners can help strengthen preparedness plans and frameworks in countries with weaker health systems. Preparedness of the health system is the first line of defense. This was a main recommendation of IEG’s evaluation on World Bank Group Support to Health Services. Better staffed health services, protective equipment, laboratory diagnostics, clinical management, surveillance systems, and rapid contact tracing skills can all allow countries to mount more effective responses.

Scaling up private capital mobilization for development: Lessons from World Bank Group experience, Web Resource,"Meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires raising trillions of dollars on an annual basis. Public resources and Official Development Assistance (ADA) will not be enough to finance the SDG agenda. Now there is the additional challenge of finding the resources to cope with the multiple consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. Mobilizing private capital has a critical role to play in filling the investment gap.  

In 2015, Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) committed to adopting a financing framework capable of unlocking, leveraging, and catalyzing more public and private financial flows. A framework where financing from private sources, including capital markets, institutional investors and businesses, has become paramount to mobilize the trillions in investments needed. 

In 2017, the World Bank Group (WBG) adopted a definition of private capital mobilization (PCM), jointly agreed with other MDBs and Development Finance Institutions (DFIs).

The WBG’s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) released its first systematic assessment on how relevant and effective the Bank Group has been at channeling private capital for development, the factors that have driven results, and opportunities for the future.

IEG’s evaluation finds that the WBG has deployed efforts across its institutions (IBRD, IFC and MIGA) to mobilize private capital either through project level co-financing and/or through pioneering mobilization instruments and platforms. Bank Group PCM approaches have proven to be relevant and have delivered results. In fact, the WBG remains one of the largest contributors to PCM, with about $32 billion mobilized in low- and middle-income countries in 2018.

 

What factors have been driving results?

Several WBG instruments and platforms have been effective in achieving development objectives through PCM. 

For example, World Bank Guarantees have achieved positive outcomes by reducing risks and improving projects’ bankability at the commitment stage. Creating the right conditions to attract private investments has led to increased financing for key infrastructure and services, benefitting people around the world when these projects reach maturity.

IFC syndicated loans have increased client firms’ access to finance and debt, and bond mobilization platforms have been effective in meeting client and investor expectations. MIGA has also been successful and has positioned itself well among MDBs in addressing PCM thanks to its new products (e.g. Credit enhancement) and the share of its exposure that gets reinsured allowing MIGA to offer more guarantees. These new products and guarantees have successfully mobilized private investments for projects ranging from power generation in Sub-Saharan Africa to capital optimization projects in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Bank Group client countries have large untapped potential to crowd in private capital. IEG modeled estimates suggest most Bank Group client countries are attracting only 50-80 percent as much private capital as they could. Unlocking this potential will be especially important to fund the recovery from the pandemic and get back on track to the SDGs.

Evidence shows that projects with domestic investor participation, MDB involvement, and World Bank–IFC–MIGA collaboration have better PCM project outcomes. 

Domestic investors boost project success by engaging actively in the design and implementation stages and by bringing knowledge of the local market and regulations. Projects with domestic investor participation had greater success (80 percent) than those with overseas investors only (60 percent).

When other MDB’s are involved, more resources become available and there are shared environmental, social, and governance compliance requirements and monitoring systems to ensure greater quality of outputs and outcomes.

Evidence from energy sector projects indicates that concomitant World Bank, IFC, and MIGA interventions have a positive effect on PCM outcomes. These joint interventions involve either working sequentially as a project’s de-risking needs and financing needs evolve.  

IFC and MIGA PCM approaches have created a demonstration effect, attracting repeat clients and increasing PCM levels. However, it is not easy to sustain private investment flows in the long term.

This demonstration effect of IFC and MIGA PCM approaches happens when IFC or MIGA support the expansion of an ongoing project or the involvement of an existing client in a new project. Investors’ repeat engagement indicates that they trust the Bank Group’s PCM approaches and believe that projects developed through the Bank Group will be sustainable.

It takes time and sustained investment, however, to generate sufficient levels of PCM to trigger a demonstrable increase in countries’ overall private capital flows. It is also essential for governments and the Bank Group to continue to support business environment reforms post-PCM and to address constraints that may limit private investments in the long term.

What opportunities lie ahead for PCM in the future?

Bank Group client countries have large untapped potential to crowd in private capital. IEG modeled estimates suggest most Bank Group client countries are attracting only 50-80 percent as much private capital as they could.

Unlocking this potential will be especially important to fund the recovery from the pandemic and get back on track to the SDGs. Both traditional Bank Group PCM solutions (for example, World Bank and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency guarantees, trade finance, and short-term liquidity facilities) and countercyclical approaches (for example, the Distressed Assets Recovery Program) can continue to play important roles in mobilizing private capital in light of the ongoing pandemic.

The Bank Group has the potential to help create a more attractive environment for private capital by supporting public policy changes, addressing the lack of a pipeline of bankable projects, and increasing collaboration with other MDBs and DFIs on PCM efforts. This requires the Bank Group to expand existing PCM platforms and approaches, to support policy reforms and disaster risk financing and to continue to innovate and develop new products aligned with the needs of new investor groups and partners.

How to Implement a Strategy to Close Gender Gaps?, Web Resource,"Many large development organizations face challenges in implementing a gender strategy. A mid-term review of the World Bank Group’s Gender Strategy uses a theory of action to illustrate the institutional factors that enable implementation.

Recent evaluations in the African Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank and the World Food Program point to difficulties in helping staff to think and act with a gender lens in their work. Key issues often revolve around who supports staff, how to resource support and what knowledge is required to assist implementation.

The current gender strategy of the World Bank Group has defined the institution’s approach since 2016. At the heart of the Gender Strategy is a move towards the prioritization of gender gaps drawing upon focused analysis, action and measurement. The gender gap approach seeks to address deficits identified in the gender mainstreaming approach (used previously), such as: weaknesses in embedding a gender equality orientation across organizations, fragmented results and low replication of success (UNU-WIDER, 2014: 13).

A recently completed IEG mid-term review of the World Bank Group’s Gender Strategy identifies opportunities to maximize implementation efforts. The review found that commitment to the Gender Strategy by Bank Group management and staff has translated into progress against plans and good practices in implementing the strategy. This commitment is reflected in changes in how organizational goals are framed and in the increased number of projects targeting gender gaps. When support was well defined, resourced, and coordinated, it helped projects address specific gender gaps for agreed priorities.

While commitment at the level of strategy is a prerequisite, actions at the level of the country portfolio and in coordinating support, are also needed. The review found that challenges in implementation arose when there was a lack of support to help identify a gender gap, limited ability to translate technical knowledge into practice, or limited monitoring of gender in projects implementation.

To visualize and discuss needed enhancements we put together what evaluators call a theory of action – a diagram that describes the important elements for implementation, their design and connections. The theory of action identified four interconnected institutional elements and factors that enable the implementation of the strategy: commitment to strategic objectives; prioritizing gaps at a country-level; coordinated support to implementation; and monitoring and evaluation of commitments and projects from design to closure. The diagram below elaborates on these four areas.

 

Commitment to Strategic Objectives

Maintaining a focus on the strategic objectives requires strong commitment from the management and governance structures of the organization. Buy-in is necessary for successful implementation of the strategy through, for example, creating staff incentives to reinforce the strategy’s aims. Without this commitment gender will not remain in focus and other areas of work will become prioritized. Implementation actions need to consistently match this commitment and be commensurate with the level of ambition in the strategy.

Prioritization of a Country-driven Approach

The gender strategy advances a country-driven approach as a critical pathway to support the closure of gender gaps. In the World Bank Group, a country driven approach is particularly important as country programs form the main unit to define, implement and review progress with national governments. The Gender Strategy highlights that sustained progress to closing gender gaps will accrue through coherent alignment from country objectives to projects, policy dialogue, diagnostics, and monitoring.

Fully addressing gender gaps takes sustained effort, spans multiple projects, and can be addressed more strategically using Bank Group instruments collectively in a country. For example, to enable more women to enter the workplace can require a change in childcare practices, which needs a coherent approach comprising of policy change, training and private sector investments to support countrywide implementation.

Coordinating Support to Implementation

To build on commitment and prioritization a country program needs a range of support. The review noted that implementation of the strategy could be enhanced when four sources of support worked together:


	knowledge generation, curation and use;
	gender groups that maintain standards, advise staff who support implementation of the strategy on the prioritization of gaps and help synergize efforts between different organizational siloes;
	gender specialists, and focal points with contextual and sector know-how who can connect different resources; and
	gender innovation labs to support new influential efforts to address gaps.


The review identified how these four sources enabled or constrained implementation of the strategy. For example, all four play a role in supporting the use of analysis to identify and address gender gaps. Gender groups and Gender Innovation Labs can invest in and champion evidence production, such as, impact evaluations, business cases, and specific studies that can assist project implementation.

Yet, even with these sources of support in place, unless operational staff receive assistance from both gender specialists and focal points, evidence on gender gaps can be difficult to access or be too hard to translate into different contexts.

Monitoring and Evaluation

Cutting across all these areas is the need to monitor and evaluate. Without processes to assess commitments, project design, implementation and outcomes, actions may fail to adapt and attention to gender may weaken. The World Bank has put in place processes to measure progress on closing gender gaps through reporting on both corporate commitments and project design, but less attention to implementation and outcomes.

With good monitoring and evaluation of gender gaps, opportunities for adaptation can be identified and the assessment of outcomes can help direct implementation towards success. For example, through monitoring supported by the Gender Action Learning System, a project in Kenya identified during implementation the need for enhanced targeting of women entrepreneurs. Further, as a result of a range of evaluation activities, a commercially viable and effective technical assistance(?) and training program for women-owned and women-led small and medium enterprises was scaled-up. Together monitoring and evaluation help to maintain focus on priority gaps and help understand if the gaps are closing meaningfully.

Final Thoughts

Ensuring synergies in support helps to overcome implementation bottlenecks. Having well organized support enables actions to be contextualized and focus on prioritized gender gaps. Enhancing internal organizational support models through improved coordination, standards and evidence translation are within the control of development agencies and as review shows, requires continued effort.

Towards a circular economy: Addressing the waste management threat, Web Resource,"Municipal solid waste poses a growing threat that surpasses local and regional boundaries. It has become a global challenge, with mounting public health, environmental, social, and economic costs. A new report from the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) finds that the World Bank Group is a leader in addressing the challenge of municipal solid waste, but investments are low compared to other sectors, and the drive toward the long-term solution of a circular economy is not yet an overarching goal.

Improper waste management leads to soil, air, and water pollution and attracts disease vectors. Mismanaged waste can clog stormwater drains, resulting in flooding that creates unsanitary and toxic conditions, disproportionately affecting poor people, who are more likely to live near or work at waste disposal locations. Burning waste releases toxins and particulate matter in the air that can cause respiratory and neurological diseases, among other health issues.

Globally, inadequate solid waste management contributes to climate change—accounting for about 5%of global carbon emissions—and to plastic pollution, which has caused damages to the marine environment estimated at $13 billion per year. About 80% of ocean plastic comes from poorly operating Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) systems.

Even more alarming is the fact that solid waste generation is growing exponentially. It is set to double in large and medium-sized cities and triple in the poorest countries by 2050. This is especially worrying since low-income countries have few sanitary landfills or recycling facilities and no incineration capabilities. Consequently, most of their waste is managed improperly, remains untreated, and is disposed of in open dumps.

IEG’s report Transitioning to a Circular Economy: An Evaluation of the World Bank Group's Support for Municipal Solid Waste Management (2010-20) assesses how well the World Bank Group has supported client countries in managing municipal solid waste, and points to sustainable solutions to the challenge while also identifying constraints to their implementation.

Addressing the challenge. A focus on financing and synergies

There is an urgent need to transition from the traditional linear economic model (take-make-dispose) and adopt widely accepted sustainable alternatives such as the waste hierarchy and circular economy approaches.

A waste hierarchy approach prioritizes waste prevention, reuse, recycling, and recovery before disposal. A circular economy closes the loop between extraction, manufacturing, and disposal by advocating for designing products to reduce waste, using products and materials for as long as possible, and recycling materials from end‐of‐life products back into the economy.

This is certainly not an easy transition as it requires greater financing to improve the capacities and systems for solid waste management and concerted action among local, regional, national, and international actors.

Financing from multilateral development institutions and the private sector for MSWM is low compared to other urban services. The International Solid Waste Association found that, between 2003 and 2012, the share of solid waste management in all official development finance was only 0.32%.

Furthermore, The Public‐Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility database shows that in 2020, MSWM received $1 billion in private investments—compared with $4 billion for water supply and sanitation. None of these funds were directed towards low-income countries, where they are needed most.

Improved synergies between local, regional, and national governments are also critical to ensure financing and service provision efforts—administered locally—are aligned with policy setting and regulatory priorities— set at the regional and national levels.  

Additionally, government collaboration with the private sector, civil society, and non-governmental organizations would also lead to higher efficiency in service delivery, improved practices, and improved accountability of service providers. It would also increase support for the informal waste picker community, which is crucial in collecting and reclaiming recyclable and reusable material.

The World Bank Group’s work on Municipal Solid Waste Management

The World Bank Group (WBG) leads Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in financing and knowledge of solid waste management. The Bank Group has also recognized and advocated for waste hierarchy and circular economy approaches for MSWM, however, it has yet to mainstream these approaches into many country strategies and operations.

The Bank Group mainly focuses on infrastructure and service delivery and has been generally effective, although success can be undermined by challenges in achieving the financial sustainability of projects. The WBG does not, however, consistently provide for some elements essential to integrated waste management, including revising policies, planning for cost recovery, involving the private sector, incorporating behavioral factors, and considering waste pickers.

The most common infrastructure activities supported by the WBG have been closing informal dumpsites, rehabilitating sanitary landfills, or building new ones. There has been relatively less emphasis on waste reduction, separation, recycling, and recovery.

The cost of inaction is high for people and the planet. World Bank Group actions going forward

WBG institutions have the potential to face this challenge in coordinated action and to partner with other development finance institutions in helping countries achieve the necessary institutional strengthening and required funding.

The WBG has room to increase private capital mobilization for MSWM, as only 27% of its projects included efforts to incentivize private sector participation.

The Bank Group can also address the growing waste management challenge in low-income countries more frequently. These countries received less than 2% of World Bank lending and no investments from the International Finance Corporation (IFC).

The World Bank Group has agreed to implement IEG’s recommendations and is therefore reaffirming its commitment to adopting and implementing waste hierarchy practices, in line with client needs and capacities. This commitment includes identifying and working to address constraints to investments in MSWM in lower-income countries; and building on its leadership position, by collaborating and convening with developmental partners to improve the management of municipal solid waste and set a course for the circular economy.

Andrew Stone, Web Resource,"Andrew Stone was previously Adviser to the Director, Sustainable, Financial and Private Sector Development and Head of the Macro Evaluation Team for the Private Sector Department. His recent evaluation work concerns State-Owned Enterprises, Trade Facilitation, Carbon Finance, the Rural Nonfarm Economy and Urban Transport. His other evaluation work has focused on support to small and medium enterprises and financial inclusion of poor households and microenterprises.

Until 2012, he was Lead Private Sector Development Specialist in the Finance and Private Sector Unit of the Middle East and North Africa Region of the World Bank. A central focus of his work has been the development and application of Investment Climate Assessments (ICAs), instrument designed to provide a standard and comparable basis for assessing conditions for private enterprise operation and growth and for developing strategy and operations to address key constraints. He led a development policy loan in Yemen and co-authored the MENA regional flagship report on private sector development: From Privilege to Competition: Unlocking Private-Led Growth in the Middle East and North Africa (2009).

At the Bank, Andrew worked on both the methods for assessing the investment climate through enterprise surveys and policy analysis and the application of those methods in a variety of countries. His survey work pioneered the assessment of costs to private enterprises of regulatory and administrative compliance. In addition, his work investigated the identification and application of appropriate institutional approaches to regulatory reform.

Mr. Stone is coauthor of the book Investment Climate Around the World: Voices of the firms from the World Business Environment Survey (with Geeta Batra and Daniel Kaufmann, World Bank, 2003) and author of multiple articles, World Bank discussion papers and web-based resources on private sector development, business transactions costs, business-government consultation and empirical evaluation of business constraints.

Independent Evaluation Group and École nationale d'administration publique formalize collaboration towards building a new global partnership   , Web Resource,"The World Bank's Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) and the École nationale d'administration publique (ENAP) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to pool resources and expertise to meet the global demand for stronger monitoring and evaluation capacity.  Working together, they will be in a much stronger position to meet this demand in key regions, including Francophone Africa, North America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East and North African regions.  

The agreement comes at a time when there is a great need for evaluation capacity building around the world, which no single organization can meet on its own. Formalizing the collaboration between IEG and ENAP will enable the two institutions to work together to share knowledge and lessons learned, coordinated their efforts and expertise, and capitalize on their respective networks to advance evaluation capacity development in key areas of the world. The collaboration will help expand the delivery of ENAP's Programme International de formation en évaluation du développement (PIFED) to geographic and linguistic spaces that remain currently under-served.

Watch IEG Director-General Alison Evans and ENAP Director-General Guy LaForest introduce this new collaboration for global evaluation capacity development.

 ""This agreement will allow ENAP and IEG to go much farther in building and developing evaluation capacity in developing countries,"" said Guy Laforest, the Executive Director of ENAP. “I am pleased that our school's expertise in evaluation is now available on a wider scale, especially in this year of the 10th anniversary of the PIFED.”

“IEG looks forward to strengthening its partnership with ENAP in order to generate synergies and thus extend the impact of the monitoring and evaluation support programs of our two institutions,” said Alison Evans, the Director General of IEG. “This partnership will enable us to support more governments and institutions in strengthening their systems and capacity to support data-based decision-making and results-based information, and thus accelerate their progress towards the sustainable development goals (SDGs).”

As a step towards signing the MoU, ENAP hosted an event during the 2020 gLOCAL Evaluation Week, which took place from June 1 to 5, and was organized by IEG and the CLEAR Initiative. ENAP held a joint panel with the Francophone Evaluation Network of Canada and International Program for Development Evaluation Training (IPDET) on the theme ""The Online Transition of Pandemic Assessment Capacity Building Practices: Challenges, Opportunities and Limits"" in which hundreds of people participated.

Mother and Child Health - Reaching 2015 Targets and Beyond, Web Resource,"The 2012 UN MDG Report highlights that in 2008, 63% of women world-wide delivered their babies attended by skilled health personnel. The good side: this is up from 53% in 1990, but it still leaves 37% of women in developing countries without sufficient care.  And, it falls short of the fifth MDG, which aims to reduce maternal mortality by 75% (for which the “proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel” was adopted as the primary indicator of progress).  Recent analysis by the World Bank, WHO, and others confirms that only ten countries have succeeded in meeting the fifth MDG, and just nine additional countries are on track to achieve it by 2015.

We asked ourselves why?

IEG recently completed a systematic review of impact evaluations on maternal and child mortality to review the evidence.  We learned that there is no credible impact evaluation evidence that investments in skilled birth attendance by themselves have succeeded in reducing maternal or neonatal mortality.  On the other hand, the mortality rate for children under five declined by 41% from 1990 to 2011. We find that non-health investments—from energy and education, to governance and income generating activities—along with health interventions that simultaneously improve both provision and utilization, have been essential.

The challenge, as we prepare for the post 2015 period will be: how do we get all the players around the same table and develop shared ideas and strategies that will deliver greater benefits to people?  The new WBG Strategy speaks to addressing this challenge: solutions that bring together partners and instruments – across sectors – to generate sustainable results.

And how about areas where evidence is insufficient to guide policy and action?  For instance, we know that we don't know enough – with sufficient certainty – about investments in early child health care. Should policy-makers or WHO in its role to establish a normative framework, wait until enough high-quality evidence is available?  

Of course not.  Instead, I suggest a coalition that entails:


	Policy-makers at WHO and elsewhere develop hypotheses of the norms they believe should be set based on their experience to date;
	 
	Evaluators undertake a series of purposeful evaluations – RCT, quasi-experimental, descriptive and qualitative – to evaluate whether these hypothesis hold based on experience with past programs.  This will require involving independent evaluation to take an arms-length look at existing programs, and real-time evaluations undertaken as part of new and ongoing programs, to learn what works and correct what doesn't, while recording feedback to inform normative and policy-making decisions;
	 
	Researchers test those aspects of the hypotheses that have not yet been tried and search for opportunities for cross-learning from other sectors; and
	 
	Policy-makers and implementers in the countries work in tandem with ongoing evaluations and researchers in piloting policy and service delivery options.



As we move to establish the post-MDG agenda, policy-makers, evaluators, and researchers should jointly develop meaningful indicators for the next round of global development goals.  These should be based in sound normative frameworks and be established by robust field-based evidence. This way, we can advance progress, drawing on each other’s strengths for better informed decisions and actions.

External Evaluation – A Guarantee for Independence?, Web Resource,"Why is independence so important? The simple answer is trust. Public institutions, such as the World Bank Group, need to account for the resources entrusted to them and the results they promised to achieve. Self-reporting and Open Data are essential to increasing trust. So is independent evaluation which validates the truthfulness of self-reporting and delivers greater in-depth analyses to understand the reasons for achievements and shortfalls. As one of my predecessors, Yves Rovani, put it in 1988: ""Internally, our independence helps ensure the choice of subjects, access to information, and candor of reporting necessary for accessing accountability and for drawing fully on the benefits of experience. Externally, it contributes to the credibility of the Bank's achievements by demonstrating publicly its openness and willingness to be the first to recognize its own shortcomings.""

Contrary to providing a second opinion, independent evaluation assesses, as objectively as humanly possible, the success and failure of policies and interventions, and reports critical findings without fear of repercussion. Independence, for that matter, serves to safeguard this objectivity of evaluation.

How best then to limit subjectivity and influence over evaluation? It sounds straight-forward: get people who are external to the institution to evaluate it, as implied in the Washington Post article U.S. push for outside oversight over the World Bank. The ""internal – external"" question can be very basic: you are ""internal"" when you work for the institution whose policies and interventions are evaluated, or you are not an employee and you are ""external"".  Underlying the idea that ""external"" is more independent are assumptions that being outside the line of command and pressures within the institution, separate from corporate culture and group think, enhances independence and impartiality, because interests might be less vested.

Independence has been a constant in my career as evaluator. I have worked for many different institutions, each of which managed the quest for impartiality in different ways, but the fundamental principles were the same: reduce biases to the greatest extent possible and report on success and failure, even when ""bad news"" is not welcome.

Recognizing the reality of these pressures and the need to manage them as well as perceptions of independence, extensive discussions about evaluation were held within the World Bank Group in 1973 – many of which were led by the U.S. government.  These discussions resulted in the establishment of an evaluation function outside of the institutional structure responsible for operational matters. Two years later, in 1975, independence was further strengthened. The Director General, Evaluation, reports directly to the Bank’s shareholders – the Executive Board – and has limits on the terms of service with no right to further employment at the World Bank. Other aspects that can limit independence – the choice of what is evaluated, the budget, and freedom to publish reports without censorship – were all addressed with similar measures. These principles became accepted as ""gold standards"" in the evaluation community and were later adopted by regional development banks and other international finance institutions.

Is this ""external"" enough? Admittedly, in all of my positions, I have been an ""internal"" evaluator – in that I was employed by the institution - and worked with ""external"" evaluators in varying roles. Yes, the external evaluators bring a different perspective and are further removed from implicit norms. They might be more impartial, although there is no guarantee of that.

Most importantly, it takes an outsider a lot longer to understand institutions, find information, establish trust, and become effective influencers.

IEG’s long-term agenda allows us to have the greatest impact on the World Bank’s development effectiveness by making strategic choices about what is evaluated, conducting evaluations that are innovative and cutting edge and that influence stakeholders during the evaluation and not just once the report is issued. We are then able to share lessons gained from experience to foster learning in the World Bank Group and with its partners. 

Our long-standing history of independence and the institutional measures in place to safeguard it have both been recognized as instrumental to increasing the credibility of the World Bank Group, which is more than an external evaluation could do.

Lessons from Ebola for the fight against Covid-19 (Coronavirus), Web Resource,"The World Bank’s support for countries facing deadly Ebola outbreaks contain some pertinent lessons for the current fight against COVID-19—and responses to future disease outbreaks.


	
		
			
			Collateral benefit
			
		
		
			
			Building incident management system capacity in countries for one disease benefited responses to other risks. For example, an established polio incident management system in Nigeria made it possible to effectively control an Ebola outbreak in that country in July 2014.
			
		
	


The efforts against Ebola from 2014 to 2019 ranged from collaboratively planning the World Bank’s response across countries, to support for addressing mental health and nutrition issues at the start of the response and improving school hygiene to ensure the safe return of children after the crisis was over.

The World Bank Group’s Independent Evaluation Group extracted the Findings for COVID-19 from the World Bank’s Support to Address Ebola Outbreaks from a rapid review of the institution’s support for addressing Ebola outbreaks in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone (2014–16), and the Democratic Republic of Congo (2017–19). 

Local and national coordination

The World Bank helped set up joint monitoring with the government and other partners of the outbreaks and response, with monitors in the communities using smartphones for real-time data tracking and for patient feedback. The World Bank also strengthened information sharing from the response at the local level, both across countries and within countries. These were useful ways to improve the coordination of emergency operations efforts at all levels. 

Another component was emergency budget support to governments, to ensure that they could carry out their Ebola response plans. For instance, in Guinea, at a time when tax revenues were reduced because of Ebola and a decline in mining revenues, a World Bank project contributed to national Ebola-related spending to finance treatment centers, training of health workers, and national sensitization campaigns.

Financial incentives for frontline workers also were critical in scaling up the response to the West Africa outbreaks. The World Bank supported training of more than 30,000 health workers, who along with volunteers, took on tasks ranging from early case detection to safe burials. At the height of the epidemic, approximately 40,000 community health workers and other volunteers received a graduated rate of compensation, depending on the risk category assigned to their role. Emergency workers, frontline health works and others, also benefited from a formal hazard payment system. These payments depended on a transparent and accountable financial incentives system, which included a list of beneficiaries, a reliable cash transfer system, and routine monitoring and reporting. 

The World Bank supported improved contact tracing, under which more than 37,000 community health workers and other volunteers were deployed for door-to-door communication and case identification in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. This surveillance required support at the community level, from stakeholders including traditional and religious leaders, women, and youth. Also critical was a comprehensive database of contacts, to track the number of cases and provide analyses of trends in the outbreak.

Laboratory and treatment response

Access to laboratory testing at community level—such as local facilities with equipment and trained technicians to conduct timely testing—was crucial to identify Ebola cases. This access to local testing in “hot spot” areas of the outbreak allowed quick collection of samples, to avoid the risk of further transmission. The World Bank supported improvements in laboratory capacities in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Furthermore, cross-border collaboration and networking among laboratories in this subregion helped improve their weak diagnostic capacities. However, during COVID-19, these countries often requested funds for the same supports as during Ebola: improvements to surveillance, laboratory capacities, and health workforce recruitment and training. Thus, investments in these response systems should be preserved and built on between outbreaks.

In late 2014, more than 50 Ebola treatment centers were needed and only 16 were operational. Therefore, Ebola patients tended to remain at home, which led to further transmission among families. The World Bank supported the establishment of community treatment centers, where infected patients could be isolated and receive basic care. The organization also provided drugs, protective gear, and other medical supplies and helped set up logistic hubs, jointly used by all partners to stock supplies. Initially, procurement of supplies through United Nations agencies was not fast enough. Therefore, direct contracting of local medical supply providers should be used in emergency situations.

Related health and nutrition issues

The Ebola crisis absorbed funds originally allocated for maternal and child health. World Bank measures to ensure the continued use of essential health services during the outbreak included providing free medical supplies for non-Ebola illnesses, reimbursing travel costs or offering transport to health facilities, providing psychosocial support and food and nutrition assistance, and improving water and sanitation in health facilities. These helped overcome the population’s fear of using health services. Also, efforts in Sierra Leone supported by the World Bank to encourage closer links between traditional and modern health system providers, and to train health care workers in cultural sensitivity, improved access to health care.

World Bank mental health interventions were designed to reduce depression, decrease stigma, and increase levels of trust at the community level. The institution supported services ranging from treatment at mental health facilities to community healing dialogues for more than 20,000 people in Liberia, and psychological services provided by more than 1,000 trained community volunteers in Guinea. 

Nutrition challenges arose because quarantines, travel restrictions, and fear of infection complicated efforts to organize farming teams, prepare fields for planting, maintain a steady supply of seed, and market produce. As a result, hungry farming families resorted to eating seed intended for the next cropping cycle. World Bank measures included food support: people in quarantined areas and affected households received food, and children in Guinea were fed at school. However, there was no protection for the planting season. Support to assure access to food and prevent undernutrition of children must be part of emergency planning at the onset of a pandemic. 


	
		
			
			Lessons from Rebuilding after Ebola
			
		
		
			
			
				Support for teacher training and improvements in school classrooms and sanitation expedited the safe return of students.
				Flexible grants and cash transfers helped support vulnerable households and geographic areas affected by Ebola. This included funds for safety nets, orphanages, female-headed households, reopening of schools, and seed and fertilizer for farmers.
				Short-term employment helped vulnerable groups recover their assets and reengage in services.
				Continued support to improve surveillance, laboratory capacities, and health workforce training for preparedness between epidemics.
				Support to recover essential health services and strengthen the continued delivery of services in the re-emergence of the epidemic, such as in areas of immunization, and improving reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child, and adolescent health services.
				Continued support for public financial management reform opportunities that emerge from the pandemic.
				Support to restore the agriculture planting seasons and child nutrition to prevent the deepening of undernutrition in communities.

Sustainable Diversification of Agrifood Economies – Insights and Lessons, Web Resource,"Public support for agriculture has historically been directed towards the production of staple foods, such as rice and wheat, or export commodities. In many developing countries, this often creates an uneven playing field for producers, who are left with limited possibilities to diversify into locally-adapted and more nutritious products that do not receive public support, but for which there is demand. While the World Bank Group has long supported efforts to increase the productivity and diversification of agrifood economies, a recent evaluation by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of this support over ten years (2010-20) found that it is insufficiently spread to support diversification toward such products. This blog summarizes the main findings and lessons for increasing diversification of agrifood systems in ways that are more sustainable and inclusive.

Challenges to diversification

In an effort to enhance national food security, governments often provide support for agriculture which can affect production and marketing decisions. This may include preferential investments in research and development, input subsidies, price support, and assured prices for certain commodities. When most public support is going to a few favored staple commodities, producers lack incentives to increase the production of products that do not benefit from large support, such as fruits, vegetables, pulses, dryland cereals, and livestock. This can be the case even when consumer demand is increasing and when expanding the production of undersupplied foods could generate high social benefits. For example, India’s public support to agriculture since the Green Revolution has emphasized production and marketing of staple cereals; public procurement is largely limited to paddy (rice) and wheat produced in few states although recent policies aim to provide price support for more diverse food crops.

Diversifying into more nutritious and undersupplied products is essential to meet the growing demand for affordable healthy diets, including fruits and vegetables. It can also provide higher incomes and help smallholders be more market-oriented in their approach to production. To be sustainable, such diversification needs to be underpinned by climate-smart approaches that reduce the environmental footprints by making efficient use of resources, such as land and water, and by protecting biodiversity.

Several recent interventions from the World Bank have aimed to increase diversification to high value products but more effort is needed. In Uzbekistan, for example, the Bank is supporting a shift from cotton and wheat toward more diversified systems that are resilient to climate shocks. Cotton and wheat consumed 72% of arable land and 90% of irrigation water and agricultural public expenditures but generated only 23% of total agricultural output. In the Gambia, the Commercial Agriculture and Value Chain project supported rice, vegetables and fruit (mango) value chains.

The World Bank’s support contributes to national food security but has not been sufficiently spread to support diversification towards higher-value and more nutritious products that are often undersupplied. While Bank financing for agriculture has contributed to strengthening national food security, more can be achieved in supporting diversification beyond key staples and livestock. Only about 4% of the World Bank’s product-targeted projects supported the production of fruits and vegetables and 11% supported food legumes. Similarly, most of the Bank’s support for livestock production focused on dairy (27%) and fish (34%). Only about 3% of livestock projects explicitly supported production of small ruminants (sheep and goats) that offer income-generating opportunities for low-income households in rainfed and drought-prone environments.

Lessons for supporting sustainable diversification

The World Bank’s support for diversification towards high value products has been particularly challenging in less favorable areas. These areas include drought-prone rainfed areas without adequate irrigation systems or have limited access to markets and services. In addition to addressing these constraints, success in supporting diversification toward undersupplied and higher-value products will require the following:


	Access to finance: Access to finance is a key driver of production of high value commodities. Farmers and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) can invest in inputs and technologies when they have access to credit at the amounts that they need and at rates they can afford. When financing is limited, matching grants can be used to facilitate investments in critical inputs and processes. For example, Vietnam’s Livestock Competitiveness and Food Safety project (LIFSAP) provided matching grants to farmer groups for investments in good animal husbandry practices, including waste treatment facilities and construction of over 17,000 biogas digesters to reduce methane emissions. Support to poultry and pig farmers strengthened links with buyers, increasing their incomes, and facilitating diversification into more sustainable livestock production.
	Food safety and quality standards: The World Bank has supported several interventions to strengthen food safety and quality standards, allowing farms and firms to produce high value and perishable commodities. For example, Vietnam’s LIFSAP project supported the upgrading and improvement of 370 slaughterhouses and 572 meat markets. This promoted adoption of food safety and waste management practices of animal production, processing, and marketing facilities. LIFASP also helped build the capacity of poultry and pig farmers, and slaughterhouses and traders operating in wet markets. This supported the strengthening of institutions that helped towards better delivery of veterinary services and modernization of food safety standards. Similarly, Montenegro’s Institutional Development and Agriculture Strengthening Project (IDASP) provided financing and helped build the capacity of eligible farmers and agro-processors to strengthen food safety standards and meet the European Union pre-accession requirements.
	Production and market infrastructure: Complementary investments in market infrastructure and equipment, such as collection points, warehousing, cold storage, and transport, are particularly important to diversify production into perishable high-value products. In India, the National Dairy Support Project (NDSP) supported small-scale dairy farmers and cooperatives and built village-based milk procurement systems with milk-quality testing. These interventions allowed small-scale farmers to participate in more lucrative, organized dairy value chains, increase milk prices, and reduce wastage. The project complemented this by helping build the capacity of the farmers and providing them better access to technologies and services to increase their productivity. This also included digital innovations that reduced costs and helped provide optimal information and services to users.
	Enabling policy environment: Diversification into high value products requires the right policy environment, including enforceable laws and regulations. In more advanced economies agriculture historically benefits from substantial public support, costing about US$640 billion per year worldwide, generating hidden social and environmental costs. In order to reduce these latent costs and create a level playing field for producers, there is merit in repurposing these biased policies to support the development of green, resilient, and inclusive agrifood economies. This also includes sustainable diversification into high value products that generate multiple social and environmental benefits. Such smart-repurposing could provide win-win solutions for reducing poverty (SDG1), improving food security, and reducing the cost of healthy diets (SDG2), while reducingglobal emissions for mitigating climate change (SDG13) and generating other social and environmental benefits. Re-aligning incentives would require: (a) removing policies that are biased against diversification that provides multiple benefits; and (b) removing restrictions on land use tied to specific crops to allow diversification (example through multiple cropping or rotations).


The above lessons are valuable in supporting clients in diversifying into high-value and more nutritious products in ways that are sustainable and inclusive of small producers and value chain actors. This can also help find viable solutions to address the growing challenges for improving global food and nutrition security

Here we go again: Debt sustainability in low-income countries , Web Resource,"Having cut my teeth on issues of debt sustainability in the mid-1990s working on the design and implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), I can’t help but have a feeling of déjà vu as concerns grow over debt sustainability in low-income countries (LICs). Unambiguously, the COVID pandemic has made things worse, but it is worth remembering that the resurgence in debt stress in LICs was evident and under active discussion in policy circles well before February 2020.

Since 2013, the number of countries eligible for concessional financing from the World Bank at high risk of, or in, debt distress has almost tripled (from 13 to 35 (33 in 2019)) and the average debt-to-GDP ratio has increased from about 40% to 60%. This occurred alongside significant support from the international community (and the World Bank in particular) to improve the debt management capacity of LICs.  Despite this, and against a backdrop of persistently low global interest rates, median interest payments from LICs rose 128% between 2013 and 2018.

Yes, hindsight is 20/20. This blog is not an attempt to claim that the current situation should have been easily anticipated (although that proposition is subject to debate) but rather to emphasize the urgency of learning from the past. It is true that many of the factors underpinning the rise in pre-COVID debt stress such as persistently low global commodity prices were not easily anticipated. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) recently completed the third in a series of macro-fiscal evaluations that consider, among other things, the evolution of debt stress in LICS, and offer insights to enhance the effectiveness of Bank Group support to strengthen fiscal resilience in LICs.  

IEG’s February 2021 Evaluation of World Bank Support for Public Financial and Debt Management in IDA-eligible Countries, focusing on the decade following the 2008 global financial crisis, notes that many LICs sharply increased non-concessional and shorter-term borrowing to finance “growth enhancing"" public investment to close infrastructure gaps and meet global development goals. Appropriately, development partners extended significant support to enhance debt management capacity over this period, with many positive results in terms of the number of countries that met minimum standards of good practice for debt management.

However, as the IEG evaluation demonstrated, this was not systematically accompanied by similar attention to the quality of public investment management (PIM), which includes the ability to systematically and transparently scrutinize the costs and benefits of public investment, in infrastructure as well as other sectors. Indeed, over the last decade, public investment management diagnostics were undertaken by the Bank for less than half of countries eligible for concessional resources from IDA, the World Bank’s fund for the poorest countries, with demand concentrated among higher-income LICs. Of the 32 IDA-eligible countries at high risk of, or in, debt distress in FY18, only 10 had received support over the previous decade from the World Bank to improve their public investment management capacity.

In July 2021, IEG released its evaluation of the World Bank Group Contributions to Addressing Country-level Fiscal and Financial Sector Vulnerabilities. This evaluation sought to assess the adequacy of the Bank Group support for macro-fiscal and financial sector crisis preparedness. It found that outside the context of stabilization efforts, the World Bank Group was less effective in working with clients to proactively expand buffers, strengthen institutions, and build capacity for better preparedness and economic crisis management. It also pointed to optimistic bias in the growth assumptions underpinning debt sustainability analyses (DSAs) as well as important gaps in the quality and availability of data on the contingent liabilities of state-owned enterprises. 

IEG will soon release its Early Stage Evaluation of IDA’s Sustainable Development Financing Policy (SDFP). The SDFP was adopted in July 2020 to incentivize IDA-eligible countries to achieve and maintain debt sustainability by moving toward more transparent and sustainable financing.  The core of SDFP incentives is the requirement for countries that, according to the DSA, are at moderate to high risk of debt distress (or in debt distress) to implement performance and policy actions (PPAs). PPAs are intended to enhance debt transparency, promote fiscal sustainability, and strengthen debt management. IDA-eligible countries estimated to be at low risk of debt stress using the DSA are exempt from the requirement to implement PPAs.  

Noting that one-third of countries that saw an elevation in their risk of debt distress over the past decade also experienced a two-level deterioration in less than three years, the evaluation recommended that a DSA finding of “low risk of debt distress” should not be sufficient to exempt an IDA-eligible country from implementing PPAs. Given the rapidity with which debt stress can build, and the well documented optimistic tendency of the DSA, the evaluation recommended that the requirement to implement PPAs not be determined solely using the DSA.  While IEG did not suggest what other criteria might be introduced for PPA exemption, LICs currently assessed at low risk of debt stress might also be required to demonstrate a minimum standard of data transparency, including with respect to contingent liabilities associated with state guarantees and state owned enterprises.

Where does that leave us now? Can we use the lessons from these three IEG evaluations to plot a path to a more resilient foundation for responsible and productive use of credit? The answer is an unequivocal “yes”.  

The recent Development Committee communique shines a light directly on the importance of debt transparency and debt management capacity, calling for the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund “to continue coordinating efforts to strengthen debt transparency and debt management capacity, including a process to strengthen the quality and consistency of debt data and improve debt disclosure, while helping many LICs and Middle Income Countries achieve debt and fiscal sustainability“.  

No one credibly disputes that greater transparency on the amounts, terms and conditions of sovereign borrowing is needed or that improvements in the ability of governments to manage their debt to minimize cost and risk is a sine qua non for responsible macroeconomic management. These are important initiatives that should continue.  

But with the costs of a potential debt sustainability crisis running well into the billions, they are not enough, and IEG’s three evaluations provide some guidance on what more might be considered.  First, we need to pay greater attention to the quality of spending that is financed with official sector borrowing. Indeed, this was clearly recognized by IDA Deputies in the context of the 19th Replenishment of IDA in their statement that “the first challenge is to assist IDA countries to ensure that the benefits [of borrowed resources] exceed the costs of servicing their debt. IDA and other partners can help by supporting initiatives that enhance capacity in areas such as public finance management, public investment management… and debt management”. 

As a start, Multilateral Development Banks, including the World Bank, should routinely include in the set of core economic and fiscal diagnostics used to inform country strategies and set priorities, an assessment of the quality of public investment management, such as the IMF’s Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA).  Countries receiving concessional support from the World Bank and seeking to be exempt from PPA implementation might also be required to regularly conduct (e.g., every five years) a Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA) to provide clarity on where greater attention is needed on debt transparency and management, with a presumption of DeMPA publication.  There are other data transparency standards that could usefully be strengthened, including the World Bank’s Debt Reporting System (DRS), whose coverage could be expanded (to include borrowing by State Owned Enterprises) and incentives for compliance could be strengthened.    

No one can say that the above actions would have prevented the pre-COVID resurgence of debt stress in IDA-eligible countries. But the intuitive appeal of proactive measures that promote higher quality public investment and better and more complete data about the borrowing behavior of governments, including state guarantees and state-owned enterprise debt, should not be controversial.  And none of these actions are pro-cyclical, which means they can be implemented even in the midst of the COVID crisis (with donor support where capacity building is necessary). They might even enhance the resilience necessary to help avert the next hidden debt crisis or resurgence of debt stress.

"
Where Will We Be in Twenty Years?, Web Resource,"The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Network on Development Evaluation  -- or EvalNet as it is known among evaluation cognoscenti -- celebrated its 30th anniversary in June 2013.  We should all lift a glass to toast this important network, which plays a central role in sharing evidence on results of international development co-operation to support learning and help hold decision makers to account.

As we celebrate 30 years of EvalNet’s achievements, lets also pause and imagine where we will be in 10 or 20 years from now!  I want to highlight five things that will be instrumental over this period.

We will see in partner and client countries more and more robust evaluation professionals, which will be better networked into a global community.  Making sure we are one community rather than a fragmented lot of different ones, and that while respecting the diversity of composition and needs of different groupings, will be a challenge.  This Network, through its evaluation capacity development work that also reaches across the community to the Banks and Foundations through the Regional Centers for Learning on Evaluation and Results (CLEAR Initiative) and the embrace of EvalPartners to the United Nations and non-government organizations, is well placed to play a role that we all need to assume.

Likewise, becoming a profession will require internationally agreed and accepted professional standards and a process of accreditation.  This is nothing new: I can recall the debates of the early 1990s, when time was not ripe to form and agree on those standards.  Today, a number of groups are engaged in defining competences.  To truly strengthen the profession we need to bring these efforts together to a global consensus, as otherwise we will suffer greater fragmentation.

In terms of methodology, great advances have been made in many fields, and the arrival of “big data” that gets generated “automatically” expands our fount of information for use in evaluation.  I would challenge us too, to look more closely at how we evaluate capacity development.  This has always been considered the highest priority in the development discourse. Yet, across all organizations, the same mistakes are repeated, both in the design, doing, and evaluating thereof.

The other methodological challenge, we will need to tackle is that of complexity.  This science is “complex” and quite often a bit wooly, because it does not follow our linear thought or speech patterns. The logical framework approach has been instrumental in shaping evaluation approaches.  It explains cause and effect and is meant to help planners as much as implementers and evaluators.  We all have seen the challenges in coming up with good frameworks and the dire consequences when they were missing.  Going forward, we need to develop the mindset and the tools to make evaluative sense of the much more complex, intertwined and dynamic reality we live in. (Richard Straub of the Harvard Business Review wrote an interesting piece on complexity.).

And finally, our influence.  We are evaluators not just because we like the research and the digging into data, or because we like the odd fight we can get out of an evaluation when we hit a raw nerve. Primarily, we do this work because we want to influence change and ensure our institutions do better, learn, grow and serve their clients.  The disciplines of behavioral science and psychology can teach us some important lessons:  people learn better when they feel good about themselves.  We humans are less rationale than economic theory thought  and therefore act on feelings and sometimes contrary to what facts should make us do, and incentives of carrots and sticks work when people do simple tasks and fail when they are engaged in complex pursuits. Now, imagine a shift that takes our institutions away from a culture of blame to one that strives for excellence and is inspired by continuous learning – and evaluation playing its part to make that happen.

Making Innovation and Entrepreneurship Work for the Poor, Web Resource,"Political Economist Joseph Schumpeter proclaimed, “carrying out innovations is the only function which is fundamental in history”. Growth in any economy comes from three sources: increases of inputs of production, efficiency improvements, and innovation. Of these, innovation is the biggest difference between developed and developing economies and is increasingly becoming key to making growth more inclusive and sustainable.

What are the key factors that contribute to an ecosystem of innovation?  Klaus Schwab, head of the World Economic Forum, stressed in a recent op-ed in the New York Times: “A strong scientific and technological base, investment from public and private sectors, links between businesses and research centers, a high-quality education system, political transparency, and a culture that encourages entrepreneurship and risk-taking.”

The World Bank Group (WBG) is uniquely positioned to help developing countries increase the supply of inclusive innovations. In 2013, IEG reviewed the World Bank Group Support for Innovation and Entrepreneurship looking into its $18.7 billion portfolio dedicated to innovation and entrepreneurship interventions over the past decade. The findings suggest that although the amount spent on this type of interventions is sizable and can contribute to major changes, it has to be complemented by other actions to be more effective.

Having a clear vision and strategy of how innovation should be used to solve major development challenges is key to the WBG’s effectiveness. This means that the institution needs to coordinate better among its networks, regions and teams as well as across the three institutions, and with public/private partners.  For instance, the evaluation shows that about 77% of World Bank projects supporting public Research and Development activities were satisfactory in achieving this objective, among which the best performers were those projects that fostered linkages between research and industry.

The WBG made a positive shift moving away from a narrow focus on market and government failures in innovation and entrepreneurship toward a much broader focus on other bottlenecks impeding innovation and entrepreneurship. The new focus and need to provide sustainable solutions require experimentation with different mechanisms and implementation arrangements. Also it means that WBG needs to carefully monitor and evaluate which interventions and mechanisms work effectively and which need to be improved.  

This brings up the issue how to best deal with risky investments into early-stage start-up firms that are known for their innovation and entrepreneurship work.  The evaluation shows that the WBG needs to do better in assessing and developing plans on how to work with such start-ups throughout their growth cycle. The WBG also needs to ensure that knowledge and learning generated from its work across countries and regions is captured better and shared systematically.

The evaluation also points out the need to better leverage existing instruments. One of such instruments is research grants used for the creation, application, and diffusion of knowledge and technology that enable innovation. Lessons from this experience suggest that these interventions must be designed and implemented in ways that are demand-driven, incorporate end-users, and support multi-stakeholder collaboration. IEG’s work shows that competitive research grants are most effective when there are transparent and rigorous selection procedures and strong institutional capacity in the research system or where additional investments were made in capacity building activities to improve proposals from weaker institutions. Yet outreach to the extreme poor has been problematic because competitive projects of this sort are not effective at targeting people without land or other productive assets.

The WBG’s pressing challenge is to harness innovation to provide sustainable solutions for the poor who live on less than $2 a day both in middle and low income countries.  Broadening involvement in inclusive innovation will be a critical strategy for achieving the WBG’s new corporate goals for poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

COP26 pledges: Can the private sector come through for climate action in emerging economies?, Web Resource,"The first week of COP26 ended with a loud and clear response from world leaders to the call for greater ambition and urgent climate action. Regardless of whether this enthusiasm is to be received with hope or with skepticism, it is important not to lose focus on the pressing theme of private capital mobilization (PCM) for climate action, without which it will be impossible to meet the Paris Agreement.

As US Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, noted in her remarks “… as big as the public sector effort is across all our countries, the $100-trillion plus price tag to address climate change globally is far bigger… and the private sector needs to play a bigger role”. In fact, developed economies have not been able to meet the $100 billion a year commitment to finance climate needs in emerging economies.

A major announcement at COP26 was the pledge of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) – a global coalition of over 450 finance firms across 45 countries, jointly managing $130 trillion - to align their financing activities to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Leaving aside fair questions as to whether it is enough or realistic, this pledge is indicative of the scale and ambition needed..

A similar pledge came earlier this year from the Climate Finance Partnership (CFP), a partnership between BlackRock and the governments of France, Germany, and Japan, as well as a number of leading U.S. impact investing organizations, to align resources towards net-zero emissions.

Just as GFANZ and CFP, private sector players are making bolder commitments representing important opportunities. But how much of this financing will reach emerging economies? What can the World Bank Group (WBG) and partner organizations do to facilitate the flow of private capital to developing countries?  IEG recently published an evaluation on the WBG’s approach to capital mobilization which includes lessons that could shed some light on these questions.

Coalitions such as GFANZ and CFP seek bankable projects, mostly in the infrastructure and energy sectors, requiring emerging economies to strengthen their policy and regulatory frameworks and raise industry standards in key sectors to attract investors. The WBG can continue to play a major role in addressing institutional barriers to private investment flows at the country level. Examples from Jordan and Ghana illustrate how WBG-supported policy and institutional reforms catalyzed private capital mobilization in the energy sector.

In Jordan, the Bank Group’s technical assistance and its support to public sector management reforms strengthened the power utility financially, boosted the development of the wind power market, and facilitated private investments in renewable energy. In Ghana, the WBG supported reforms to strengthen the financial sustainability of the state off-taker in the power sector and promoted the introduction of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative standards, which facilitated private investments.

With the release of its 2021-25 Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP), the WBG put forward strong commitments to mobilize more private capital for climate action and prioritize adaptation efforts, recognizing that developing countries are bearing the brunt of climate change effects. Avenues to mobilize private capital streams into adaptation are not near as wide and clear as they are for mitigation. In fact, only 2% of tracked adaptation finance comes from the private sector. Turning this around will require a great deal of innovation from the WBG and all other Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) to structure instruments and platforms that yield PCM deals for adaptation in emerging economies.

Through its CCAP, the WBG is committing to linking climate and development goals and integrating climate objectives into all its work. Similarly, the Bank Group -and other DFIs – should seek to structurally expand PCM efforts across all sectors and regions by creating more incentives for teams to increase their financial structuring expertise and use of PCM mechanisms, even in sectors where financing is typically done through direct lending.

The WBG, and other DFIs, have thus a critical role in ensuring pledges like that of the GFANZ and the CFP represent opportunities for emerging economies. Greater innovation is required to ensure valuable financial structuring expertise is mainstreamed and geared towards all sectors, including those associated with adaptation efforts.

As the global development community moves forward with its efforts to mobilize private investment towards climate and development objectives, clarity regarding the standards and taxonomy surrounding climate finance should also be achieved. Avoiding confusion regarding the differences between climate finance, green finance, transformational finance, etc., can prevent these terminologies from becoming another obstacle for the flow of private capital to where its most needed.

IEG is committed to building a strong body of evaluation evidence and gathering lessons, identifying what works and what doesn’t, as the WBG advances private capital mobilization towards achieving its green, resilient, and inclusive development objectives.

Laos - Completion and learning review for country partnership framework for the period FY2012-FY2016 : IEG Review, Web Resource ,"Lao PDR is a small, landlocked, lower middle income country that for some years has enjoyed rapid economic growth (around 7.8 percent over the past decade including the CPS period). In 2015, GNI per capita was $1,740, which was below Vietnam ($1,990) but well above Cambodia
($1,070). While poverty has been reduced, inequality has been rising and growth has not been inclusive. The latest available Gini index of 37.8 in 2012 shows a noticeable increase from 34.6 in 2002. For the same period, Lao PDR Gini index is about the same level as Vietnam (38.7), but much higher than Cambodia (30.7). The CPS focused on stronger public sector management as a cross-cutting theme, with three strategic thematic areas: competitiveness and connectivity, sustainable natural resource management, and inclusive development. The CPS and the CPSPR addressed important priorities and drew on lessons from the previous program, including on the critical importance of capacity building that needed to be embedded into broader sectoral programs rather than through separate activities. However, it is not clear to what extent the program actually succeeded in this regard, and only a few of the objectives and/or outcome indicators in the CPS/CPS Progress Report results matrix seem to relate to capacity building.

IDA Internal Controls: Evaluation of Management's Remediation Program, PDF file,"The key purpose of the International Development Agency's (IDA) internal control system is to assure its stakeholders that IDA complies with its articles and policies and that the funds it provides for development purposes are used as intended and show measurable results.
This evaluation, which started in 2005, was the first of its kind done by any international development finance institution. It was carried out over several stages and resulted in three major reports, at each stage including a detailed management self-assessment, a review by the Bank's Internal Auditing Department (IAD), and a comprehensive independent evaluation by IEG.
At the end of the process, a senior outside advisory panel (three distinguished former Auditor-Generals) validated IEG's approach and conclusions.
IEG found at the time that, overall, IDA's internal controls framework operated effectively and with high standards, but with some important qualifications.
Most importantly, IEG identified one important weakness (classified as a Material Weakness) in the complex of controls to manage the risk of fraud and corruption in IDA-supported operations. This finding was based on the identification of the risk that fraud and corruption may occur rather than on an assessment of actual occurrences.
IEG also identified six Significant Deficiencies (SDs)âthese are also important issues but do not rise to the level of a Material Weakness.", ,Content Type : Reports,"October 1, 2010

Cost-Benefit Analysis in World Bank Projects, PDF file,"Historically, the World Bank's reputation for rigorous analysis was built on its use of cost-benefit analysis. Such analysis served to demonstrate its commitment to measuring results and ensuring accountability. It was the Bank's answer to the results agenda long before that term became popular.
IEG's evaluation reveals that the percentage of World Bank projects justified by cost-benefit analysis has been declining for several decades, due to both a decline in adherence to policy and difficulty in applying cost-benefit analysis. This study highlights that the Bank needs to revisit the policy for cost-benefit analysis to account for difficulties in quantifying benefits yet preserve a high degree of rigor in justifying projects. The study recommends that the Bank implement reforms to ensure quality, rigor, and objectivity in its cost-benefit analysis, and use the results to influence decisions and improve develpment assistance.", ,Content Type : Reports,"October 1, 2010

Earnings Growth and Employment Creation: An Assessment of World Bank Support in Three Middle-Income Countries, PDF file,"The Bank has identified five policy areas that affect employment: macroeconomic conditions, investment climate, labor regulations, education, and social protection. This study uses this MILES framework, as it is known, to assess the Bank's assistance to three middle-income countries (MICs)âColombia, Tunisia, and Turkeyâduring 1998-2007. The assessment considers the impact of the Bank on policies, and the impact of these policies on employment and earnings.  The comparative analysis of a set of country programs is an approach to drawing lessons that may be useful in other situations, such as the current global financial crisis, where numerous MICs face similar employment creation and earnings growth challenges.
The three countries had very different experiences during the evaluation period.  Colombia went through a deep recession during 1998-99 that increased its unemployment rate to unprecedented levels; Tunisia experienced a high unemployment rate that resisted efforts to reduce it for decades; and  Turkey also saw a sharp rise in unemployment as it implemented structural reforms to stabilize its economy after many years of double-digit inflation, and its employment ratio continued its long-term decline. This evaluation found that employment-related outcomes in the three countries were mixed, with notable progress in economic growth, earnings, and poverty reduction, but not in the employment-to-population ratio or the unemployment rate.  Second, Bank program objectives in the three countries focused more on MILES components than on employment itself. Third, Bank support in the three countries achieved differential progress in the individual MILES components, with the most progress on macroeconomic stabilization, followed in approximate order by progress on the investment climate, education, social protection, and labor taxation and regulations.  IEG rates the outcome of the Bank program in Colombia with respect to progress in employment and earnings growth as moderately satisfactory. The outcome of the Bank program in Tunisia relating to employment and earnings growth is rated satisfactory. The outcome of the Bank program in Turkey with respect to employment and earnings is rated moderately satisfactory.","Country :  Colombia, Tunisia, Turkey",Content Type : Reports,"February 23, 2011

Evaluation of World Bank Assistance on Trade (Approach Paper), Web Resource ,"Three main factors underpin the Trade Assistance Evaluation.  First, while several evaluations of Bank assistance on trade for individual projects or specific programs occurred up to the early nineties, no comprehensive evaluation of Bank assistance on trade covering the full range of client countries has been conducted. Previous earlier OED evaluations looked at: trade liberalization experience in nine countries, trade and adjustment in Africa, support for industrial activities, agricultural sector adjustment loans, and lending for port development.  In addition World Bank (2001) summarizes the Bank's conclusions from its dialogue with NGOs under SAPRI and focuses, among other things, on the results for trade liberalization.  Second, several trade-related issues remain operationally relevant - the optimal path and sequencing of trade reform, the impact of trade adjustment on the poor, determining the appropriate role of the state, and the role and importance of additional complementary policies.  Third, in the run up to the Doha Development Agenda Ministerial in November 2001 and since, the Bank has expanded its trade work at several levels - research, advocacy, capacity building and in operational activities.", ,Content Type : Reports,"March 17, 2004

Countries that improved their policies during this period grew at about twice the rate of countries that did not. Bank lending was concentrated in countries that were improving their policies. In many cases, Bank programs (including all forms of Bank support - not just adjustment lending) contributed to policy improvements. Bank country assistance has had satisfactory outcomes in about 70% of the cases evaluated by OED. Satisfactory outcomes were achieved by a range of policy and institutional options and Bank program designs. In cases where outcomes were not satisfactory, contributing factors  included inadequate country knowledge, programs that were poorly aligned with country policy-making styles, over-optimism in debt sustainability analysis, and/or attempts to transplant policies or institutions without adequate consideration of country-specific factors. Project outcomes for FY02 are 79% satisfactory and exceed the Strategic Compact target of 75%.

China - Inland Waterways Project, Web Resource ,"The outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory. Construction of all planned infrastructure was completed to a high standard, but traffic to some of the transfer port facilities did not materialize in the volumes expected due to changes in the market following the deregulation of the transport sector. There was also some delay in compensation payments to residents affected by the creation of the reservoir in Guangxi Province, but all of these payment issues have now been resolved. No safeguard contraventions were recorded and a good overall rate of return of 22 percent was achieved for the project. Average vessel size increased and power output from the dams equaled or exceeded projections. The assessment considers the objectives of the project fully achieved. The institutional development impact is rated substantial. The project has led to the development of two corporatized entities responsible for the implementation of the project in Guangxi and Hunan provinces, where a power generation component was included. In Zhejiang Province, the project was implemented by a Project Administration Unit of the Zhejiang Provincial Port and Waterways Administration and the repayment of the loan was effected through the provincial treasury; control systems for quality of work, timing and payment were in accordance with the FÃÂ©dÃÂ©ration Internationale d'IngÃÂ©nieurs-Conseils (FIDIC) conditions, and dam safety panels were set up under the project and continue to be used for similar projects of this nature.

Pension Reform: How to Strengthen World Bank Assistance (REACH), PDF file,"The Bank has been a leader in pension reform, providing extensive financial and technical support to many countries. The Bank's strategy supports a flexible, multi-pillar framework, under appropriate macroeconomic, social and financial conditions. The Bank has assisted both pay-as-you-go (PAYG) and multi-pillar pension systems, although much lending and non-lending work has focused on countries implementing multi-pillar reforms. In countries in which initial multi-pillar conditions were not in place, the Bank generally supported purely PAYG reforms. Nonetheless, in a number of instances, the Bank supported multi-pillar reforms even though there were clear weaknesses in the country's underlying economic and financial structure. Moreover, the Bank did not always fully consider non-contributory options to expand the social safety net to the populace outside the formal system. Bank-supported reforms often have contributed to fiscal sustainability. But, despite expectations, in many countries with multi-pillar systems, funded pensions remain poorly diversified and pension coverage has not increased. In addition, the secondary objectives of funded pillars-to increase savings, develop capital markets, and improve labor flexibility-remain largely unrealized. The evaluation recommends the development of guidelines to ensure that assistance is well-tailored to country conditions and argues that more attention needs to be paid to building institutional capacity if reforms are to be sustainable.", ,Content Type : Reports,"February 2, 2006

The challenges are to build effective capacity in trade and to make trade an integral part of country development strategies. The Bank has been an important source of financial and technical support to many countries on trade. The Bank's strategy has evolved from analytical and advisory work and lending towards a broader approach including advocacy and participation in the global dialogue on trade.

Support for Smaller Enterprises, PDF file,"The Bank has often supported small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) to encourage employment of lower-paid wage earners and to diversify and broaden the base of an economy. The strategy for smaller enterprises has generally been to ease the scarcity of term finance by providing funds and improving the banking system's ability to lend to them. Thought to be labor-intensive, especially outside the major urban centers, small firms would create jobs at a low cost, which would improve the distribution of income and alleviate poverty. All wonderful outcomes.	But such outcomes are rare. Smaller enterprises can be less labor-intensive and less efficient than larger firms. Access to finance is a problem. And the Bank's financial sector policy, with Operational Directive 8.30 in 1992, reduced lending to SMEs.

Ajuste en Rumania tras la guerra fría, PDF file,"En 1991-92, el Banco Mundial reanudÃÂ³ sus relaciones con Rumania al aprobar dos prÃÂ©stamos para financiar importaciones industriales de emergencia y apoyar reformas para liberalizar los mercados. En una evaluaciÃÂ³n ex post de los proyectos realizada por el DEO* se determinÃÂ³ que el prÃÂ©stamo para fines de ajuste habÃÂ­a sido fructÃÂ­fero, pero que el destinado a importaciones esenciales habÃÂ­a surtido escasos efectos.
El ÃÂ©xito moderado obtenido por el prÃÂ©stamo para ajuste obedeciÃÂ³, sobre todo, a que el Banco sostuvo firmemente los principios bÃÂ¡sicos de la reforma en las negociaciones con tres gobiernos consecutivos. En el caso del prÃÂ©stamo para importaciones esenciales, la insuficiente atenciÃÂ³n prestada a la ejecuciÃÂ³n del proyecto ocasionÃÂ³ demoras que redujeron la eficacia de la operaciÃÂ³n.

O Grupo Banco Mundial em Moçambique: lições de uma história de sucesso que se desviou, Web Resource,"Graças ao seu forte crescimento económico e a medidas de redução da pobreza, Moçambique foi um caso de sucesso de desenvolvimento até 2016.  Nas duas décadas após o fim da guerra civil que terminou em 1992, o produto interno bruto (PIB) cresceu em média quase 8% por ano (gráfico A, abaixo), tornando o país numa das 10 economias com maior crescimento em todo o mundo.  Este fenómeno impulsionou a renda e o nível de vida do país, que contava com um crescimento médio anual do PIB per capita de 4,8% enquanto a taxa de pobreza caiu de 60,3% em 2002–03 para 48,4% em 2014–15 (gráfico B).  Estes resultados foram possíveis graças a um cenário de estabilidade política e macroeconómica, que forneceram a base para a recuperação do sector agrícola e para atrair um investimento estrangeiro significativo. Durante este período, Moçambique recebeu um enorme apoio de doadores, pelo qual o país ganhou a reputação de ser uma “estrela em ascenção” ou o “preferido dos doadores”.

Crescimento Económico e Redução de Pobreza em Moçambique

No entanto, tudo mudou em 2016, quando uma crise gerada por uma dívida não declarada afundou Moçambique numa grave crise económica.  Um novo relatório do Grupo de Avaliação Independente (Independent Evaluation Group, IEG) acompanha as mudanças de cenário e as respostas às mesmas, enquanto avalia o programa desenvolvido pelo Banco Mundial em Moçambique entre 2008 e 2021. Em 2016, a existência de grandes empréstimos externos não declarados veio à tona quando o governo moçambicano estava a negociar uma restruturação de empréstimos altamente controversos contraídos em 2013, com o intuito de financiar a Empresa Moçambicana de Atum (EMATUM). O valor dos empréstimos não divulgados e não concessionais correspondia a 10% do PIB (1,4 mil milhões de dólares). Estes tinham contraídos pelo governo entre 2009 e 2014, através de garantias a empresas estatais e empréstimos directos de credores bilaterais. Após esta revelação, a moeda desvalorizou drasticamente, a inflação disparou, o espaço orçamental contraiu-se, o crescimento anual médio caiu pela metade, de 7,7% entre 2000 e 2016 para 3,3% entre 2016 e 2019, e o investimento estrangeiro directo esvaiu-se, à medida que os investidores perderam a confiança no país

Esta dívida não declarada também influenciou negativamente o acesso a financiamento concessional, com o auxílio públicos caindo de 17,5% para 12,4% do PIB. Quando a dívida não declarada foi contabilizada, a dívida pública externa moçambicana com garantia pública disparou de 61% do PIB em 2016 para 104% em 2018. Este aumento vertiginoso do serviço da dívida fez com que Moçambique declarasse moratória em 2016.

O que correu mal?

Quatro factores contribuíram para esta situação tempestuosa: (1) a influência de poderosas elites no aparelho estatal; (2) o acesso em grande escala a financiamento não concessional associado à descoberta de grandes depósitos de gás natural; (3) supervisão inadequada das empresas estatais; (4) fraco investimento público e gestão da dívida. Nem o Banco Mundial nem a comunidade de desenvolvimento anteciparam as graves consequências desta conjugação de factores. Antes deste escândalo, o Banco Mundial seguia uma abordagem maioritariamente focada no reforço de capacidades técnico-institucionais, sem dar a devida atenção ao estado da economia política e aos riscos associados de corrupção. Os riscos orçamentais eram encarados, em grande medida, recorrendo a reformas e ao apoio à capacidade de produzir e publicar Estratégias da Dívida de Médio Prazo (Medium Term Debt Strategies, MTDS na sigla inglesa) e relatórios fiscais e de dívida. Em contraste, uma abordagem mais centrada em governanção teria implicado um apoio maior à implantação de mecanismos de controle prévio aos empréstimos e ao investimento público, alinhados à Análise de Dívida Sustentável (ADS) do país.

O Banco Mundial realizou diversos diagnósticos de gestão financeira pública e de dívida, mas não usou as suas descobertas para informar as prioridades de reforma operacional ou política, incluindo a série de operações de auxílio orçamental apoiada pelo Banco. Estas falhas destacaram-se especialmente nas conclusões do relatório produzido no âmbito do Quadro de Avaliação do Desempenho de Gestão da Dívida (DeMPA, na sigla inglesa) de 2008, que alertou para lacunas graves na declaração e registo da dívida.

Em certa medida, a falta de atenção a estas deficiências sistémicas foi o resultado de uma coordenação e priorização inadequadas no  apoio do Banco Mundial à gestão de finanças públicas e da dívida. Embora o Banco Mundial tenha fornecido apoio significativo para aspectos iniciais da gestão da dívida (como preparação de estratégias de gestão da dívida), tardou na resposta a aspectos subsequentes (declaração e registo da dívida, análise de riscos e custos, processos e procedimentos de dívida). Além disso, durante a maior parte do período avaliado o apoio à gestão da dívida não foi sistematicamente acompanhado por esforços para melhorar a gestão de investimento público, embora a sinergia entre empréstimos e qualidade de investimento público seja amplamente reconhecida. Assim sendo, perderam-se oportunidades de potenciar o crescimento e o impacto da despesa em desenvolvimento e investimento público financiado por dívida.

O que aprendemos?


	Em contextos onde existe forte influência das elites no Estado e corrupção, as soluções meramente técnicas para gestão da dívida e finanças públicas não alcançam os resultados desejados, a menos que as deficiências de governanção também sejam confrontadas.
	Diagnósticos de base são essenciais para informar as reformas prioritárias, mas também requerem acompanhamento deliberado e coordenado e maior operacionalização entre os diversos mecanismos.
	A qualidade e impacto da assistência do Banco Mundial às finanças públicas e gestão de dívida podem ser reforçados se houver uma melhor coordenação e priorização internas.

Private Sector and Fragile States: Getting the Job Done!

Private sector financing and solutions are key to supporting livelihoods and creating jobs in fragile and conflict-affected areas, alongside efforts to address the root causes of fragility and conflict. The evidence from operational experience demonstrates that, with the appropriate incentives and enabling circumstances, progress can be made.

IEG has compiled evidence from evaluation and validation reports relevant to creating an enabling environment for a private sector path out of fragility.

The International Finance Corporation's Engagement in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations
 


	IFC’s experience in different fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS) contexts confirms the critical importance of focusing advisory support on building firm-level capacity, including strengthening corporate governance; training staff and managers, and strengthening internal risk management.
	A WBG-wide, collaborative approach to address constraints to private-sector engagement in FCS is key to help catalyze private solutions to development challenges. Several IFC investments in the telecom sector helped develop a broader regulatory reform program including establishment of a telecom regulatory agency supported by the World Bank.
	Investments that develop upstream or downstream linkages to local businesses help to build up private sector activity and can create the conditions for more lasting development results.
	In higher-risk contexts, collaboration across the institutions of the World Bank Group and with other finance institutions and donors is important to attract private sector investment.

Convening for Peace: Lessons from Evaluating the World Bank Group, Web Resource,"More and more, the World Bank Group is contributing to international collective action to realize Sustainable Development Goal 16 for just and peaceful societies. A recent evaluation assesses the Bank Group’s global engagements of this kind. It finds that the Bank Group is a sought-after global player. Aligning global convening efforts with in-country programs, and monitoring them systematically, could further benefit the World Bank Group’s convening for peace.

This week the World Bank will wrap up its Fragility Forum, a biennial event that brings together practitioners and policymakers from around the world to exchange knowledge about engaging in contexts affected by fragility, conflict and violence (FCV).

The World Bank Group’s ability to bring together, or convene, actors on major global issues this way is an example of the convening power it holds.

Alongside its capacity to mobilize financing and provide advisory and analytical services to address development challenges, the Bank Group’s role as a global convener is a cornerstone of its value proposition to clients and shareholders. How well does the Bank Group deploy its convening power? IEG recently explored this.

We assessed how the World Bank Group convenes international partners to act collectively on global issues critical to its mission. This is a first-of-its-kind evaluation, that explores what global issues the Bank Group convenes on, what factors drive its convening choices, and what factors determine its convening effectiveness.

We found that that the World Bank Group is increasingly engaging in efforts that relate to fragile contexts, driven by high demands from shareholders and donors to help achieve Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16) on peace. The Bank Group largely meets these demands, assuming the role of a responsive global convener.

Aligning the World Bank Group’s global and country-level work 

Stakeholders typically request the Bank Group to work in tandem with other specialized international organizations, particularly the UN, when convening around FCV issues.  Our evaluation found that the Bank Group’s convenings on many such themes – including crisis response, forced displacement, and the humanitarian-development-peace nexus – are indeed based on strong collaborations with different development partners, including the UN.

{""preview_thumbnail"":""/sites/default/files/Data/styles/video_embed_wysiwyg_preview/public/video_thumbnails/us-rtIMc4Ro.jpg?itok=uRrLyqDT"",""video_url"":""https://youtu.be/us-rtIMc4Ro"",""settings"":{""responsive"":0,""width"":""854"",""height"":""480"",""autoplay"":0},""settings_summary"":[""Embedded Video (854x480).""]}

A recent IEG evaluation finds that the World Bank Group has strong comparative advantages in catalyzing action on global agendas.

Some of the Bank Group’s financial mechanisms to address FCV and forced displacement respond to demand from prominent stakeholders to help shape multilateral responses to these issues. Financial mechanisms such as the State and Peacebuilding Fund, the Global Concessional Financing Facility for middle-income countries, and IDA, including IDA’s Sub-Window for Refugees and Host Communities, help make the Bank a stronger convener on FCV issues.

At the same time, our interviews and case studies identified weaker translation of these global agendas into country-level engagements. While at times this can be due to political sensitivities of operating in FCV contexts, our findings suggest that internally within the World Bank Group, the global work could benefit from more consistent reflection in country programs. This could help ensure better results on the ground.

At times, the Bank Group’s country engagement model can be limiting when addressing challenges that cross national boundaries. World Bank projects predominantly implement country-focused solutions – improving coordination across the Bank’s country teams, and strengthening ownership of regional programs among partner governments, could benefit the global work.

 

Improving accountability for convening results

The share of the World Bank’s operating budget going to global engagements is around 13 percent. Yet there is no clear system to track convening initiatives and results.

Successful global convening should lead to outcomes such as shared understanding, or changes in positions and attitudes; shared solutions, or negotiated changes in standards, policies, and financing practices; and shared implementation, or setting up programs and partnerships to finance and coordinate given development challenges.

In the absence of tracking systems, managerial attention to the convening portfolio risks being uneven and less systematic. Attention gets paid to some prominent initiatives and many of the formal partnership programs.

However, there is less oversight of convening initiatives when they are managed below the corporate level, at the department or vice-presidential unit levels. This occurs because convening initiatives sometimes lack explicitly stated objectives, success cannot be measured easily, and managing units face relatively weak accountability for their performance.

To improve the effectiveness of global convening, including on efforts to support Sustainable Development Goal 16, corporate processes and systems could better support managing convening initiatives over their life cycle. Many of the global and regional initiatives that the World Bank Group convenes in the space of fragility, conflict, and violence are relatively recent, and some have already passed their piloting phase. It is critical to have these initiatives periodically assessed to ensure better selectivity of global engagements and a focus on results.

The report seeks to inform discussions about the Bank Group’s role as a major actor on global development policy issues at a time when demand for collective response to crises is increasing but support for multilateralism from major powers is fragile.

What makes a good teacher? (Hint: commitment and training)  , Web Resource,"We all instinctively recognize a good teacher when we meet one—someone who brings the subject matter to life, makes it relevant, supports critical engagement, and so much more. Many of us can name at least one teacher who made a big difference in our educational journey. Perhaps that is why writers and movie makers—from the musty days of Goodbye, Mr. Chips and Blackboard Jungle, to Sidney Poitier in To Sir with Love to Meryl Streep in Music of the Heart, to Robin Williams in Dead Poet’s Society and Richard Dreyfuss in Mr. Holland’s Opus—have found success in relating stories of the profound effect that good teachers can have on learning and on the lives of their students.

While the personal and vocational qualities that characterize all good teachers are important, other factors also inform the making and nurturing of good teachers, including quality training. In this three-part blog series drawing on the findings of IEG’s Selected Drivers of Education Quality: Pre- and In-Service Teacher Training we first discuss what underpins effective teacher training then, in subsequent blogs, we look at World Bank support for quality teaching. Of course, we recognize that context—governance, the policy environment, the quality of service delivery, resources, incentives—can also shape and influence how teachers are trained and the expectations under which they operate. Even allowing for this, the importance of training in producing quality teachers who contribute to quality learning outcomes cannot be underestimated.

So, what do we know? First, we know that teacher effort and capacity are critical to student learning and educational outcomes. We also know, as highlighted in the World Development Report 2018: Learning to Realize the Promise of Education, that quality learning is, or at least should be, central to any education system. Finally, we know that, in line with the World Bank’s Human Capital Project, education is critical for human development. Put simply, we know that the stakes are high.

As such, and as illustrated below, support for professional development to improve teacher capacity—both pre-service and in-service—is a critical input in pursuit of education quality.

Quality pre-service training relies, in the first instance, on screening and filtering mechanisms designed to ensure the selection of quality candidates. But the efficacy of these mechanisms is itself reliant on high demand premised on the attractiveness of teaching compared to other professions. The attractiveness of teaching rests on factors such as initial pay, career opportunities, incentive and support structures, classroom and school working conditions, as well as cultural aspects related to how society views teachers. To ensure the selection of quality of candidates, screening requires transparent and meaningful requirements to enter and exit pre-service institutions, such as examinations, grades, or graduation requirements.

Coursework in both content and pedagogical knowledge that is grounded in the curricula of the schools where trainee teachers will eventually teach is clearly essential. This requires the availability of qualified teacher educators who can impart relevant skills. But it also needs to be supported by the necessary learning materials as well as the requisite duration and intensity of teacher training courses –determined with reference to context—to ensure the development  of effective teachers.

Teaching involves the mastery and exercise of various skills, which makes practicum—the supervised practical application of a previously or concurrently studied field or theory—a critical component of well-rounded professional development. Effective practicums help teachers gradually assume more tasks and more responsibilities supported by monitoring and mentoring based on productive partnerships between training institutions and schools. This, in turn, should help create a trainee-centered experience that allows for formative assessment based on constructive feedback, accompanied by reflection and dialogue.

Effective quality assurance mechanisms can underpin the entire education system through, for example, provision of accreditation for training institutions and support for certification and alternative preparation for teaching. More specifically, quality assurance can underpin quality, objectivity, and transparency for both pre- and in-service training systems. It can help ensure adherence to training standards, removal of political influence, and the exercise of effective control over the number of candidates entering the system. Quality assurance can also ensure regulation of screening mechanisms regarding, for example, the implementation and integrity of assessment and examinations, providing clear signals that such screening mechanisms are free from manipulation.

Finally, quality in-service training can be vital in supplementing and improving teachers’ instructional practices and knowledge conducive to student learning. Quality in-service training observes adult learning principles, is implemented over an adequate duration, and offers sustained follow-up support through coaching or feedback that promotes reflection. It may be easier to ensure the presence of these characteristics in smaller pilot efforts, but it is imperative, if enhanced learning outcomes are the focus, that quality is maintained and sustained when in-service training is scaled up.

In the second and third blog in this series we elaborate on what the World Bank has done to support pre- and in-service teacher training, where it has placed an emphasis, what it has done well, and where it might need to improve to scale-up training programs.

Adapting development in response to population aging, Web Resource,"Population aging is no longer just a rich country phenomenon. Thanks to dramatic improvements in nutrition, sanitation, health, education, and—more generally—economic well-being, longevity has increased everywhere in the world, while fertility has decreased in most countries. This increasingly global demographic shift, unfolding in the developing world at a striking pace, brings a range of new policy challenges, including critical implications for economic growth, inter- and intragenerational equity, and the inclusiveness of the development process.

IEG’s recent report, World Bank Support to Aging Countries, offers the first assessment of World Bank efforts to help developing countries think through the challenges associated with population aging, and adapting policies and institutions to prevent and address those challenges.

 

Demographic Transition Stage World Map

Population aging can put downward pressure on long-term economic growth through reductions in employment and labor productivity, higher dependency, and lower savings and investments. However, these negative impacts do not materialize if longevity is achieved by adding healthy years, which allows individuals to stay productive and independent for longer, and if the economy uses opportunities to produce higher savings and investments during the first demographic dividend (see box).


	
		
			
			The Demographic Transition
			
		
		
			
			The 2015/2016 Global Monitoring report classifies countries into four stages of demographic transition:

			
				pre-dividend countries (where fertility is greater than 4 births per woman);
				early-dividend countries (where fertility is lower than 4 births per woman, but there is an increasing working-age population);
				late-dividend countries (with a shrinking working-age population but where fertility fell only recently); and
				post-dividend countries (with a shrinking working-age population and where fertility fell below the replacement level, or 2.1 births per woman, three decades earlier).
			

			The latter two stages characterize aging countries. The first demographic dividend is the accelerated economic growth that may result from a decline in a country’s birth and death rates and the subsequent change in the age structure of the population.
			
		
	


 

The report found that the World Bank’s understanding of aging has improved over time, from a narrow focus on the sustainability of pension systems to a much broader perspective that explores the interconnections among different sectors of the economy and calls for coordinated policy responses.

Yet there is still not enough attention paid to the profound distributional issues that population aging can cause. These include gender gaps, intergenerational disparities, and various types of inequalities: spatial, rural versus urban, and socioeconomic. A focus on gender is especially important, as there are multiple sources of gender inequalities in relation to aging. These are a result of gender differences in life expectancy, employment patterns, accumulation of pension entitlements, and care responsibilities.

The evaluation found good examples of World Bank’s analytical work providing a solid and substantial empirical base and directly influencing the policy discussion. Country aging reports have been in some cases instrumental in stimulating the need to act to address the many challenges of population aging and have generated concrete responses by governments. The Country Aging Report for Uruguay, for instance, generated a new sense of local urgency and led to a country development strategy strongly centered on aging.

In other cases, high-quality diagnostic work has helped countries to develop approaches to tackle specific issues, such as long-term care. Analytical work for China supported the design and implementation of the country aged-care system, with a strong emphasis on home- and community-based care, while promoting an efficient market for provision of care services.

While the evaluation identified good examples of analytical work, for the World Bank to better help its client countries address their aging challenges, it needs to focus more on preparedness and improve its cross-sectoral thinking.

Focusing on preparedness means promoting healthier behaviors for a healthy longevity, supporting productivity throughout the working life, and introducing incentives to save for retirement. It also means promoting financial awareness, age-friendly environments such as smart cities, or changing negative attitudes toward older people.

Thinking cross-sectorally means recognizing the linkages across issues and the broader impacts that sectoral interventions can have, some of them unintended. For example, elderly care interventions can deepen the occupational segregation of women in mostly informal and low-paid long-term care jobs; pension reforms that aim at making a system more financially sustainable tend to penalize women, who have more irregular working patterns, earn lower wages, and contribute less to a pension system.

The speed of demographic change requires new approaches to development that recognize the importance of supporting a healthier and more productive population to reduce the potential negative impact of population aging on future growth and prosperity. For the World Bank, this means articulating a clearer and more coordinated position with respect to population aging that will facilitate dialogue with client countries and improve the Bank’s capacity to provide support.

"Poland - First, Second, and Third Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project", Web Resource ,"The Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews the Poland Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Projects I through III in support of rehabilitation of Poland's national road network and strengthening of its road sector institutions at the time of Poland's accession to the European Union. This assessment was selected as input into the March 2013 IEG evaluation âImproving Institutional Capability and Financial Viability to Sustain Transport â An Evaluation of World Bank Group Support since 2002.â The three projects were designed as hybrid operations, combining a sector-wide approach for the physical works components completed within about a year's time with the lengthier institutional development components. The three road periods were approved in March 2004, March 2005, and June 2006. The closing dates for the first two projects were extended through December 2008 and June 2009, while the third project closed as planned in September 2011.  
Outcomes for both the first and second project are rated moderately unsatisfactory, while the rating for the third projects is rated moderately satisfactory. The key lessons derived include (i) when planning sequential operations that involve sector reforms, it is important to develop realistic timeframes to achieve satisfactory implementation of both the fast-disbursing civil works components and the inherently lengthier institutional development components; (ii) the use of country systems, combined with adequate ex-post audits, can contribute to fast disbursement of quality civil works output. Fiduciary and safeguards oversightâbased on ex-post auditsâof the efficacy of internal controls is particularly useful for improved capacity-building in this regard; (iii) it is crucial to take into account budget constraints when using Highway Development and Maintenance (HDM-4) analysis. Using HDM-4 to analyze only the rates of return on rehabilitation projects ignores the financial viability aspect of the program, and pays little attention to improving the number of roads in poor condition. The rehabilitation program should be designed to deliver a maintainable network within a reasonable timeframe, and this requires taking into consideration a realistic budget envelope over the program period; and (iv) objectives are more likely to be achieved when these have comprehensive monitoring indicators. While proper indicators were set for most objectives, there were no indicators linked to the objective of achieving reliable and stable funding of road maintenance or financial viability. This may have contributed to the program's difficulty in achieving significant progress on this sub-objective.",Country :  Poland,Content Type : Reports,"December 18, 2013

What is the best way to train teachers before they start teaching? , Web Resource,"The first blog in this series discussed the importance of good teachers and how such teachers are “made.” It also examined factors underpinning quality teacher training, a critical driver of quality learning that is, in turn, a key outcome for any education system. This time, again drawing on a recent report by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), Selected Drivers of Education Quality: Pre- and In-Service Teacher Training, we focus on the World Bank Group’s support for initial or preservice teacher training, what it has emphasized, and what may require more emphasis to align with the literature and evidence.

The scale of support for preservice teacher training

Between fiscal year 2013 and FY18, more than half (110 of 207) projects approved under the supervision of the World Bank Group’s Education Global Practice provided some support for the professional development of teachers. The majority supported in-service teacher training (the subject of the third blog in this series) and 40 supported the more complex area of preservice training, that is, from the initial stages of teachers’ career to their entry into the profession.

World Bank Group task team leaders (TTLs) interviewed by IEG for this report explained that the greater emphasis on in-service training was principally due to obstacles and constraints that can arise with preservice training. These include sensitive and complex political economy issues related to preservice institutions, as well as the much larger investment of time and resources required to intervene in such training, which government clients are often unwilling to take on. It should be noted that teacher training projects—like World Bank Group–supported education projects more generally—are implemented more often in low- and lower-middle-income countries, where the need is greatest.

How projects engage with the factors that support quality preservice training

Among the 40 World Bank Group operations that supported preservice training, 70 percent (28 projects) focused on coursework and had a lesser focus on the other three factors—screening mechanisms, practicums or “practice teaching” and quality assurance. All of these consistently have been identified as key elements that support quality delivery of training. One project addressed all four factors, as shown in the figure.



Screening mechanisms. The literature is clear that the use of various quality screening mechanisms across all teacher training tends to support quality learning outcomes. For example, in the Dominican Republic Support to the National Education Pact, an assessment of candidates’ capabilities was used at their entry into preservice training to tailor programs and otherwise provide remediation when candidates did not have the competencies to successfully participate in available training. In most of the nine World Bank Group operations that addressed screening, preservice institutions often relied on a single requirement for entry, such as level of completed education. This most likely reflected a desire not to deter candidates in situations where student enrollments were growing. Thirteen of the operations referred to interventions designed to improve the attractiveness of the teaching profession, a positive step toward ensuring a longer-term pipeline of quality candidates into the profession.

Coursework. Among the 28 operations that addressed coursework, IEG’s report found a mostly balanced attention to subject matter and pedagogical skills. Attention to both clearly is important, as even the basics of content and teacher preparation cannot be assumed in poor countries. Recent World Bank Group Service Delivery Indicator studies found that few primary teachers demonstrated mastery of primary-level content—a finding also highlighted by IEG’s analysis. Thus, the initial selection mechanisms have far-reaching consequences for teacher coursework, because a more capable trainee cadre is likely to already have completed higher-level coursework in the subject matter.

While coursework must be grounded in relevant curricula, it also needs to be delivered by qualified teacher educators who can impart relevant skills over an adequate time period, backed up by suitable materials. About half of the 40 operations provided some capacity development to teacher educators that was focused on pedagogical methods. About 70 percent supported soft infrastructure, including teaching materials such as textbooks, videos, and information and communication technology, and half of the projects financed infrastructure or renovations for preservice training institutions.

Practicums. Among the 15 World Bank Group projects that focused on practicums, the intensity of support varied and that variation also was observed in data analysis. For example, among Latin American countries participating in the Third Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study, extremely low percentages of teachers reported a practicum as part of their training in some Central American countries, in comparison with countries in South America. World Bank Group support for practicums was extensive in some instances, such as the Mauritania Basic Education Sector Support Project in Africa. However, in interviews, TTLs described the approach to practicums in many low-income countries as “sink or swim,” in which trainees were given too much autonomy too soon and without a qualified mentor. In these cases, there is a need for clearer national policy that defines practicum features, as well as systematic guidance about responsibilities for both the teacher training centers and the schools where the practice takes place.

Quality assurance. The literature and available data showed that countries with weak accreditation systems either had no effective control over training institutions or relied on voluntary participation mechanisms. TTLs concurred and noted that countries may have had no accreditation mechanism, or that those in place often were subjected to political interference. TTLs cautioned against accrediting a flawed system. They espoused instead effective monitoring and accreditation mechanisms that regulate providers of teacher education programs, to ensure their adherence to training standards and to remove political influences. These mechanisms also can regulate entrance and exit examinations to ensure quality.

Next: In-service training

One consequence of the low quality of preservice training systems is the need to use in-service training to compensate for underprepared or unqualified teachers. In the final blog in this series, we will look at World Bank Group support for in-service training and at the factors relevant to scaling up teacher training programs that, in their pilot phase, showed promise.

What will it take to learn fast to save lives during COVID-19 (coronavirus)?, Web Resource,"In an emergency room, much as in the response to a global crisis such as the coronavirus pandemic, saving lives requires teams to learn fast, to shift their thinking, and to adapt their practices in real time. It requires the application of simple, nimble practices for evaluating, learning, and reacting—not the creation of detailed planning or checklists—but processes for gathering and sharing knowledge about what is working, what is failing, and why. 

Luckily, there are a suite of nimble tools, linked to a practice called Emergent Learning that can easily be adapted by teams working on the  World Bank’s crisis response. Tools like the After Action Review (AAR), first developed by the United States military to extract lessons and shift tactics between battle, can be applied at pivot points in project operational cycles. The Harvard Business Review Article, Learning in the Thick of it, describes how the army, and many fast-moving, consumer goods companies, use the tool to generate and distill raw data from the front line, and to feed this back into the implementation cycle. An AAR can be conducted anywhere, often, and is most effective when carried out at key decision points throughout an implementation cycle. It is also most effective when all team members are engaged in the process. The tool is used—and is increasingly gaining traction—amongst humanitarian agencies, beginning with the Tsunami response.

IEGs 2014 evaluation, How the Bank Learns, called on the World Bank to “to become better at learning from lending”—a need all the more dire in the times of COVID-19.  The evaluation challenged the World Bank to integrate lessons from active experience—from both effective and failed efforts—into ongoing operations, even if that meant changing a course of action. This is the point of emergent learning: it promotes contestation and iteration. It encourages the organization and its operations to make learning a part of all activities, and part of everyday work, and less an isolated chore. With increasingly complex development challenges, this becomes ever more important.

There has been a wide call for organizations, including the World Bank, to think differently—to integrate complexity into development practice—and to make learning an integral part of the way that they think and act. At the World Bank, Michael Woolcock makes the case for iterative and adaptive work. In his work with the British government’s Department of International Development (DFID), Ramalingam navigates the “wicked development problem”: the gap between what is trying to be achieved, and the methods being used to achieve it. Flexible, adaptable approaches were happening despite DFID’s corporate processes, not because of them. Oxfam’s Duncan Green provides hope and optimism about how change can happen. As Green puts it, quoting Milton Friedman much before the COVID crisis, ""only a crisis produces real change”.

Or, we can take a cue from Benedict Carey, in his book, How We Learn. Did you know that taking a test on a subject before you know anything about it improves subsequent learning? The premise seems absurd, but it reminds us that stimulating our awareness of context and refining the parameters of a problem are helpful in identifying and formulating solutions. In addition to AARs, the field of emergent learning offers four essential tools for making the approach to the current pandemic more effective:


	The ‘Framing Question' is built with the simple phase: “What will it take to”….[deliver healthcare to the most vulnerable COVID-19 patients?]. It creates a focus for collective learning by asking what it will take to achieve a desired outcome. It is a forward-focused, action-oriented challenge to the group to ensure alignment around an agreed premise or idea. When done well, the framing question is at once a mechanism to coalesce around a desired outcome and a means to define individual contributions. A good framing question has the ability to ""train a group’s attention forward, in a collective inquiry that leads to action”.
	Emergent Learning Tables needed to surface and capture data, insights, formulate hypotheses and identify opportunities for further action. A way to “bring the team around the table”—the tool encourages teams to reflect by asking ‘what do we know so far?” Importantly, the process helps the team make a deliberate connection between the past and the future to ensure that previous lessons inform subsequent actions.
	‘Before Action Review’ is an opportunity to discuss in detail what success will look like, and to establish intended results and identify anticipated pitfalls. The review sets the team on a learning pathway—linked to iterative, and often held, 'After Action Review' (see below).
	‘After Action Review’ enables real time reflection on how the actual results compare with the intended ones. What caused the results and what will sustain or improve them?

As countries and organizations like the World Bank Group move quickly to respond to the COVID-19 crisis, nimble tools are needed to shine a light on and assess what is working and what is not. Traditional monitoring and evaluation approaches—built on established theories and project baselines—are of limited use in a fast-moving and constantly changing crisis. Project teams should be encouraged and supported to reach for a wider set of emergent learning tools for enhanced contestability, and to create an environment of constant learning and where mistakes are acknowledged—and where both contribute to improving the impact of interventions. The stakes are high: during the times of COVID-19, learning fast can help protect the most vulnerable and ultimately save lives.

"What do cities need to grow equitably, sustainably and build resilience?", Web Resource,"Cities will be home to 2 billion new residents by 2045. Accommodating this growth will require large-scale development of land in and around urban areas. For lower‐income cities, this will be challenging since they tend to grow through slums and other informal settlements. Along with a  lack of adequate and equitable access to public services and economic opportunities, slum residents   are more vulnerable to diseases, especially highly communicable ones such as COVID-19, and they are likelier to bear the brunt of natural disasters associated with using land that is environmentally sensitive, unprotected, or more susceptible to  disasters. In 2014, an estimated 880 million urban residents lived in slum conditions, compared with 792 million in 2000 (UN 2019). This number is likely to keep growing unless urban spatial expansion is planned and managed well.  

IEG recently assessed the World Bank’s support to client countries on managing urban expansion, particularly through its work on land administration, land‐use planning, and land development. These three key factors determine how urban areas grow.

Land administration

Land administration is the process of establishing, recording, and disseminating information about the ownership, value, and use of land and its associated resources. Making available such fundamental reference information through wider records systems is key towards recognizing a continuity of property rights and ensuring the security of tenure. This, in turn, will motivate households to invest in dwellings and contribute towards creating functioning land markets, which are crucial for the development of cities.

World Bank support to land administration is successfully strengthening property rights through land titling, which contributes to land market development. However, countries eligible for IDA, the World Bank’s fund for the poorest countries, have faced challenges with land titling and land records data management systems, which, in turn, affects their ability to develop land markets. This is partially due to limited technical capacity locally and issues related to political economy. Government planning and policies regarding land administration may not be sufficiently adapted to the local context, including the diverse and, sometimes, conflicting political and economic incentives and motivations that are at play at the local level. The political economy around land administration laws is often complex, and the time taken to reform them typically goes beyond the duration of related projects, and at times, political cycles.

Land‐use planning

Land-use planning helps regulate the use of space, focusing not only on the physical aspect, but also the economic functions, social impact, and the location of different activities within the urban environment. One of the critical functions of land-use planning is the allocation of land to private and public uses, including infrastructure and services. World Bank support to clients on land-use planning has generally been successful, but it rarely supports implementing land-use planning tools that focus on preventing the emergence of new slums or informal areas. This is critical to managing urban spatial growth. The Bank has been encouraging the establishment of independent planning agencies, which help develop preventative approaches, but it has not provided the operational support that is needed for such agencies.  

Land development

Land development is the transformation of land through investments and this evaluation assessed it through two components: first, urban upgrading, which is the improvement of conditions in existing slums and preventing the growth of new ones, and second, urban transport, which includes integrating transportation with land use. These components shape how land is used and how its use evolves over time, in turn, defining how productive and inclusive cities will become in the future.  

World Bank support to land development has been generally successful, but Bank projects on urban upgrading have tended to focus on upgrading existing slum areas and improving the access of slum-dwellers to infrastructure and housing. It has focused less on preventing the emergence of new slums and informal areas. On urban transport, because of the traditional focus on mobility and access, the Bank’s support does not systematically consider land prices and land markets. Excluding land market assessments from urban transport projects leads to underestimating the total economic benefits of these projects as well as not fully accounting for the benefits and opportunities that an increase in the value of land offers to various income groups, especially those from lower-income segments.   

There is also a lack of systematic geolocation of the World Bank’s investments, which further limit the Bank’s ability to support countries in assessing changes in land use, increases in land values, and the associated distributional impacts. 

Lessons learned and way forward

There are three specific areas where the World Bank can enhance its support to countries in managing their urban spatial growth.


	Adopting a framework that links determinants of urban expansion with strategies for managing it, in an integrated way: The framework could act as a reference for the design and delivery of the Bank’s lending and analytical work on urban spatial growth. The framework could reflect the approach of the Planning, Connecting, and Financing Cities report, the World Bank Group housing framework, the transport-oriented guidelines and recent findings from Pancakes to Pyramids: City Form to Promote Sustainable Growth report.
	Adopting preventive approaches in addition to curative ones: This could be done by securing rights of way and financing basic infrastructure in emerging neighborhoods to accommodate new urban dwellers. The World Bank should support the use of public transit, walking, and cycling as primary modes of transportation. It should also expand the use of land‐based planning tools and approaches, such as scenario planning, which is a process to support informed decision-making helping urban planners navigate future uncertainties.
	Identifying and recording precise project locations and collecting land market data: The World Bank should strengthen its data collection protocols and increase the use of technologies such as the Geo‐Enabling Initiative for Monitoring and Supervision and the Smart Supervision Application. It should also improve the collection of land market data, including mainstreaming land market assessments in World Bank investments in urban areas.


When countries manage well the factors that determine urban expansion, it can lead to fewer slums, efficient and resilient use of land, functioning land markets, and integrated urban transport systems. These, in turn, will ensure that the expansion in urban areas occurs in ways that are sustainable, efficient, and equitable.

The World Bank Group will need to adopt new approaches, frameworks, and technologies that enhance its ability to support clients, especially IDA countries, on urban expansion. This will contribute directly to Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 11, which address the need for equitable, inclusive, and sustainable use of and access to economic resources, including land, and will help the World Bank Group respond more effectively and efficiently to the twin goals – poverty reduction and shared prosperity. In addition, this will also support countries in managing their urban expansion in ways that consider the infrastructure and services that are needed to help them be more resilient towards chronic stresses and future shocks, such as pandemics and natural disasters. This will facilitate the World Bank Group’s goal of green, resilient, inclusive development.

"Measuring development outcomes of private sector investments: results, risks and outcome types", Web Resource,"The private sector plays a critical role in promoting sustainable and inclusive development across the world. In view of its importance, a range of actors invest now in promoting the private sector in developing countries and regions. These actors span across the World Bank Group’s private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and risk guarantee arm, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and a growing number of impact investors, along with a host of bilateral, private and multilateral organizations in between. One question they all face, is how to measure the development outcomes of their investments.

One approach adopted by both IFC and MIGA, and in some form by several other investors, is to identify expected development outcomes ahead of time, and use them as the basis for a framework to monitor and evaluate the progress and outcomes of investment projects. As a result of these various efforts, there has been increasing focus on improving the measurement of development outcome and the harmonization of the indicators and methods used, which would facilitate the comparison of outcomes. It has also led to a better understanding of the types of development outcomes and the key stakeholders who benefit from investments to support the private sector. 

The development outcome types are as varied as the range of investors. One typical outcome involves increased access to goods and services.  Other frequently found outcome types include improved quality of goods and services or enhanced capacity of private sector stakeholders.  There is also a variety in the level and complexity of outcomes, such as improved living standards of individuals and increased productivity of enterprises, although these higher-level outcomes are not widely and systematically tracked for private sector investments. These would include higher-level outcomes at the sector and country level, such as increased competition, and the improved function and integration of markets. Yet despite their diversity, there is one trait they all share for the moment: little is known as to whether certain outcome types are hard to achieve, and if so, which ones?

An analysis of outcome types of IFC projects

The 2021 Results and Performance of the World Bank Group report included an analysis of the varying degrees of difficulty in achieving different outcome types.  The main purpose of the analysis was to assess the relationship between certain outcome types and evaluation ratings and to determine what ratings actually reveal about the outcome types, and if higher ratings necessarily meant higher outcomes. 

For IFC, the assessment focused on a group of IFC projects which were evaluated between 2012 and 2019, and to which the IFC’s newly created ex-ante and monitoring framework -AIMM (Anticipated Impact Measurement & Monitoring) system - was retroactively applied.  The findings indicate that outcome types related to higher level, market outcome are, in general, harder to achieve compared to project level outcomes or harder to measure. This is because the achievement of market-level outcomes depends on the broader market environment and external factors such as the government actions.  It is important to mention that in the analysis, the outcomes are only considered achieved if there is sufficient evidence to verify their achievements.  In this regard, market outcomes are particularly hard to measure because of their longer-term nature, lack of good indicators, and the relatively smaller impact of one specific project. Among market outcomes, those related to enhanced competitiveness, integration, and sustainability in the market had lower achievement rates – and evidence for such outcome is hard to be obtained.

Among the outcome types which would impact directly on project stakeholders, outcome types related to increased access to goods and services, particularly those related to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), are relatively hard to achieve, compared with outcome types related to the quality of goods and services or increased linkage with suppliers and distributors. For example, increasing access to goods and services for MSMEs requires expanding lending to MSMEs, enabling them to borrow from financial institutions, which is not entirely within the control of the project. 

Some limitations of the analysis.

The above results should be taken with certain caveats.  The assessment was based on the projects to which the AIMM system was retroactively applied, meaning the rigor that the framework should bring might not have been present at project approval.  In addition, IEG’ assessments of the achievements do not necessarily coincide with the monitoring results based on the AIMM system, where different timing between the monitoring and evaluation could be one of the reasons for the difference. Therefore, along with ongoing efforts to understand the varying challenges presented by different outcome types, it would also be helpful to continue the assessment of different degrees of achievements per outcome type, especially when projects with original AIMM assessments are evaluated.

Another important aspect to be considered is the relationship between achievements of outcomes and evaluation ratings. The RAP assessment showed that harder-to-achieve development outcomes are not necessarily accompanied by lower evaluation ratings in the IFC’s projects, because the evaluation ratings do not only take into account the achievement of development objectives but other factors, such as industry benchmarks and unintended outcomes (For more detail, please see the RAP.)  In some other evaluation approaches, on the other hand, the achievement of higher development outcomes that are aligned with the original project objectives may have higher weights in assigning the rating. Therefore, the relationship between the achievement of development outcomes and evaluation rating needs further analyses and further refinement of evaluation systems may be warranted.   

Lessons for future approaches 

With the above caveats in mind, the outcome type analysis has several implications:


	Factoring in risk:  Understanding the different degree of achievements per outcome type would help in identifying the risks in achieving specific outcome types. If achieving access to finance for MSMEs proved to be more challenging, for example, there should be a recognition of higher risk of achieving such an outcome at project approval so that an informed decision can be taken, or mitigation actions taken.  If an ex-ante scoring/rating tool incorporates risks for achieving outcomes, it would benefit from the information on the difficulty of achieving certain outcome types.
	Ratings/scores for development outcomes: Currently, there are various approaches to assigning scores and ratings for the expected and actual development outcome. In the approaches taken by IFC’s AIMM system, the ratings and scores are based on the magnitude of a project’s contribution to address a country’s development challenges. For example, power generation capacity added by the project is assessed against the country’s power deficit.  However, in most cases, rating or scoring mechanisms are not necessarily differentiated by the type of outcome and their level of challenges.  For instance, expanding access to finance for MSMEs would not be assigned a higher weight than improving the quality of the access to finance for MSME.  Adding these aspects into the rating/scoring mechanism might lead to ratings and scores that offer a more comprehensive picture of the outcomes assessed.
	Enhancing results measurements: As mentioned before, the analysis of outcome achievement identified a higher share of outcomes for which properly measuring the development outcome is a challenge. This is particularly the case for market outcomes, where nearly a third of outcomes lacked proper evidence.  Results measurements have been more advanced for outcome types which are considered more immediate or direct outcomes, such as increased direct employment.  Further efforts are needed for the effective monitoring of higher-level outcomes, which are related to the living standards or productivity of intended beneficiaries as well as market level outcomes. The ongoing efforts promoted through AIMM in IFC is encouraging, as it identifies clear outcome claims and related indicators and monitor them. This is expected to enhance result measurement overall and allow better identification of different degrees of challenges to achieve certain development outcome types. In addition, further harmonization or alignment of ex-ante and monitoring frameworks among development finance institutions and impact investors would allow comparison and benchmarking of the results achieved by different players, further enabling better understanding of the nature of development outcomes and the impact of investments in the private sector.

The Quality of Results Frameworks in Development Policy Operations, PDF file,"This review on the Results Frameworks (RFs) of development policy operations (DPOs) is part of a
series of assessments to gain new insight into the factors that influence the design, implementation,
and performance of policy lending of the World Bank. The review aims to help fill gaps in the
Bank's knowledge about the results orientation of DPOs and implications for achieving institutional
change that improves a borrower's sustained growth and poverty reduction outlook. It synthesizes
and reexamines existing evidence on the quality of RFs and its contribution to the success of lending
programs. It also derives lessons from the recent use of DPOs by focusing on the identification of
successful operational arrangements that may improve a program's overall outcomes. In addition, it
aims to strengthen learning in the Bank and the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) and to
influence debate on the design and use of DPOs, especially as the Bank prepares the next DPO
retrospective.

🎧 Learning from Development Policy Financing , Web Resource,"

Development Policy Financing (DPF) is a major instrument of multilateral development banks and has played a prominent role in the World Bank’s pandemic response. Also known as policy-based lending, DPF is a fast-dispersing instrument that provides non-earmarked funds to a country's national budget. How does DPF work and how successful has it been in achieving its various objectives? The World Bank’s Director of Policy Operations, Stéphane Guimbert, and IEG host Jeff Chelsky take stock of the trends and lessons of using policy-based lending to support developing economies.

Ukraine - First and Second Programmatic Financial Sector Development Policy Loan, Web Resource ,"This Project Performance Assessment Report evaluates a programmatic series of two development policy loans (DPLs) to Ukraine of $500 million each that were provided as part of an urgent international effort to assist the country when Ukraine’s financial sector teetered on the edge of collapse in 2014. A perfect storm had affected the financial system when the geopolitical situation had descended into deep crisis arising from the Euromaidan political upheaval, the Russian Federation’s annexation of Crimea, and the armed separatist movement in the eastern part of the country that initiated open, armed conflict that at times resembled a full-scale war. The exchange rate virtually halved between the end of 2013 (Hrv 8.13 to 1 U.S. dollar) and the end of 2014 (Hrv 15.8 to 1 U.S. dollar), inflation accelerated to 24 percent, the public sector fiscal deficit exceeded 10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and public debt—including guarantees—spiked to 70 percent of GDP.

Ratings for the First and Second Programmatic Financial Sector Development Policy Loan are as follows: Outcome was satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was high, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons from the projects include: (i) Close coordination among donors is critical for DPLs to maximize the effectiveness of a jointly designed reform program. (ii) The design of DPLs needs to focus on all relevant issues, potential weaknesses, and gaps in reform measures. (iii) The presence of task teams in the field can be a critical factor in promoting financial sector reform. (iv) Weak public understanding of financial sector reforms indicates a need to expand outreach efforts to enhance political sustainability. (v) Sustainable reform is difficult to achieve in countries that have corrupt power structures and court systems. Under such circumstances, it is an open question whether World Bank assistance risks providing additional resources for rent seeking rather than support for reforms.

	Approach Paper: Evaluation of World Bank Group Support to Creating an Enabling Environment for Private Sector Participation in Climate Action, Fiscal Years 2013–22 (2023)
	Evaluation Insight Note: Transport Decarbonization (2023) - Transport is a priority action area under the World Bank’s Climate Change Action Plan. Climate action in the transport sector is essential as the sector emits approximately 24 percent of the global total of energy-related carbon emissions and, without aggressive measures, the World Bank expects emissions from transport to grow 60 percent by 2050. This EIN was guided by the overall question: How has the World Bank been approaching transport decarbonization? To answer this question, the note uses existing evidence from the self-evaluation system of the World Bank, including Implementation Completion and Results Reports prepared by the project teams and the associated Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) validations, relevant information from other project documents, literature from policy and academic sources, advisory services and analytics, country strategies, and existing IEG evaluations.
	International Finance Corporation Additionality in Middle-Income Countries (2023) - Additionality is a core feature of private sector development finance institutions (DFIs). It is the unique contribution that a DFI or a multilateral/ bilateral bank brings to a private investment project that is not offered by commercial sources of finance. The key idea is that the investment project should add value without crowding out private sector activity. Identifying and articulating project additionality is particularly important in middle- income countries (MICs) since financial markets in MICs are more developed, and private investment far exceeds official development assistance. This evaluation report examines the relevance and effectiveness of IFC’s approach to additionality in MICs and seeks to explain the factors that contribute to or constrain its realization.
	WBG Support to Demand-Side Energy Efficiency (2023) - Energy Efficiency is a critical component of the World Bank Group’s (WBG’s) commitment to the Paris Agreement, SDG 13 (combating climate change), and SDG 7 (improving access to affordable and clean energy). The WBG’s Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) recognizes energy efficiency as one of the most cost-effective ways to combat climate change and to support countries’ aims of achieving net-zero CO2 emissions through decarbonization. This report assesses the effectiveness and coherence of the WBG’s support to clients on demand-side energy efficiency (DSEE) projects and the opportunities to scale them up.
	Reducing Disaster Risks from Natural Hazards (2022) - Disasters caused by natural hazards increasingly threaten the lives and livelihoods of the world’s poor and cause billions of dollars in damages every year. Disadvantaged and vulnerable populations are most at risk as they typically reside in highly exposed areas, lose larger shares of their wealth to disasters, and have limited assets and access to social networks for coping and recovery. Climate change is further exacerbating negative disaster impacts by contributing to more destructive and frequent droughts, floods, and storms. The poorest countries are bearing the brunt of disaster impacts. According to World Bank data, 82 percent of deaths since 1970 caused by natural hazards and extreme weather occurred in low- and lower-middle-income countries.
	Toward Productive, Inclusive, and Sustainable Farms and Agribusiness Firms (2022) - Well-functioning agrifood systems have an important role to play in increasing food security and advancing sustainable development, especially in low-income countries (LICs). They are vital for achieving a number of the sustainable development goals (SDGs), including ending hunger, malnutrition, and poverty, and addressing climate change. In low-income countries (LICs), agrifood systems account for more than 30 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and generate about 70 percent of all jobs. Agrifood systems comprise the actors engaged in agriculture and the related food industry and services, the activities they perform, and the enabling environments (policies, standards, and investments) that shape their dynamic development.
	Transitioning to a Circular Economy – An Evaluation of the WBG’s Support for Municipal Solid Waste Management (2010-20) (2022) - The impact of municipal solid waste has surpassed local and regional boundaries and has become a global challenge, with mounting public health, environmental, social, and economic costs. In this context, there is an imperative need to move on from the traditional linear economic model (take-make-dispose) and adopt sustainable alternatives such as the waste hierarchy and circular economy approaches. The evaluation covers all World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) activities related to Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) during fiscal years 2010–2020 and assesses the relevance of the Bank Group’s approach and engagement in meeting client country needs, considering the latest evidence and thinking on MSWM practices and country context and readiness. The report evaluates the Bank Group’s cohesion across its institutions—World Bank, IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), as well as its collaboration and partnerships with other actors to support better outcomes for client MSWM needs. Finally, the report assesses the effectiveness of Bank Group engagements in delivering improved MSWM for clients and the factors that explain such effectiveness.
	The Natural Resource Degradation and Vulnerability Nexus – An Evaluation of the WBG Support for sustainable and inclusive natural resource management (2009-2019) (2021) - Over a half of a billion people live in extreme poverty, most of whom depend on natural resources for their survival. Yet these resources are becoming increasingly degraded, and climate change threatens to increase the vulnerability of the poor. The natural resources that are highly degraded and the people who are highly vulnerable are interconnected by the “natural resource degradation and human vulnerability nexus,” which is the subject of this evaluation.
	Renewable Energy: Evaluation of the WBG’s support for electricity supply from renewable resources, 2000-2017 (2020) - This evaluation offers the Independent Evaluation Group’s first systematic assessment of the World Bank Group’s support for renewable energy. Renewable energy has a critical role to play in the Clean Energy Transition, the pathway for decarbonizing global energy which is essential to foster inclusive and sustainable growth while addressing climate change. The share of Renewable Energy in global power generation will need to double by 2030 (from over 25% in 2017) to meet Clean Energy Transition targets. Over 70% of the required Renewable Energy scale-up is forecast to take place in developing and emerging economies. The Bank Group’s renewable energy portfolio has scaled up significantly since 2012, plateauing recently at $22 billion. While the Bank Group’s financial commitments are a fraction of total global renewable investments, it is the single largest global contributor to renewable energy in developing countries and can contribute to the Clean Energy Transition by helping clients address key barriers through its investments and policy advice.
	Building Urban Resilience: An Evaluation of the World Bank Group’s Evolving Experience (2007-2017) (2019) - Most urban growth is taking place in developing countries and emerging economies in an informal and unmanaged way. An estimated 1.4 million people move into urban areas each week. Rapid urban growth creates socioeconomic vulnerabilities and puts pressure on cities that find themselves unable to provide basic services in the face of acute shocks, such as floods, or because of chronic stresses, like water scarcity and crime and violence. Cities that invest in and implement policies that build resilience are better equipped to cope with shocks and chronic stresses; adapt to changing conditions; and transform themselves into resilient cities. Weak urban resilience, on the other hand, perpetuates the poverty trap: the urban poor living in unsafe areas, including informal settlements, are often the most vulnerable to risks and suffer disproportionately when they materialize.

	The WBG’s Partnership with the Global Environment Facility (2013) - The World Bank Group plays three major roles in the GEF: (a) as the Trustee of the GEF and related trust funds; (b) as one of the three original Implementing Agencies of GEF-funded projects; and (c) providing administrative services as the host of the functionally independent GEF Secretariat. The principal objectives of this Review were (1) to help improve the relevance and effectiveness of the Bank Group’s partnership with the GEF, and (2) to draw lessons for the Bank Group’s partnership with the GEF and other large global partnership programs. The GEF is representative of the growing number of large partnerships in which the Bank has become involved that are financing country-level investments to achieve specific Millennium Development Goals, that have inclusive governance structures, and that subscribe to the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Pre-dating the Millennium Declaration by a decade, the GEF also provides a longer time period from which to draw lessons about the Bank’s involvement in such programs.

Changes in Carbon Markets and Regulatory Systems from Kyoto to Paris and How the World Bank Group Responded to these Changes (Working Paper), PDF file,"This study provides a structured review of the existing literature on changes in international market mechanisms for greenhouse gas reductions and related regulatory systems. The assessment period 1997 to 2016 starts with the signing of the Kyoto Protocol and ends with the entry into force of the Paris Agreement. It can be differentiated into a period of emergence of market mechanisms until 2005, a gold rush from 2006 to 2011, a fragmentation of markets lasting until 2015, and a brief post-Paris period of relaunch, of a new climate policy agreement. A key aspect of the review is how the World Bank Group responded to changes. The review includes about 300 peer-reviewed articles and about 40 articles from gray literature coming from highly-reputed sources. A large share of the literature examined covers the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol with a strong focus on the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). This is a consequence of the unexpected success of the CDM in the carbon market, at least until 2011–12, as well as the transparency of the mechanism that has facilitated research. As topics and issues related to the international carbon market emerged, the Bank Group tried to address them, focusing on developing countries to enhance their participation in the market. However, there is only limited peer-reviewed literature that assesses the Bank Group strategies and operations. Key changes in markets and regulatory frameworks as well as the responses of the Bank Group can be grouped into four main periods that are briefly discussed below.

Role in Global Issues: An Independent Evaluation of the World Bank Group Convening Power (Approach Paper), PDF file,"Recent World Bank Group (WBG) strategy documents, including the Forward Look, reiterated the importance of the WBG’s leadership role in dealing with global challenges and positioned the organization’s ability to work at the nexus of local and global issues such as climate change, gender, and pandemics as core part of its value proposition (World Bank 2013 and 2016). When the WBG shareholders committed to scale up WBG resources through the recent IBRD and IFC capital increase and the IDA18 replenishment in 2016, a core premise was to more strategically perform its global role, in better collaboration with public and private partners. This evaluation is about the WBG’s global role. It will assess how and when the WBG exercises convening power to spark collective action on global issues. Given the scale and interconnectedness of global challenges; increased complexity of the development ecosystem; and concerns over “mission creep”, the WBG’s role as a catalyst for collective action on behalf of the international community could become even more important.

How Does Knowledge on Public Expenditures Integrate with the Design of Development Policy Operations? , PDF file,"	Integration of knowledge with lending is an enduring theme in World Bank strategies at the corporate and country levels. The Bank lending instruments could be more relevant and produce better results if they incorporate key analytical, country-level knowledge. The goal of this learning product is to contribute modestly to the understanding of how this knowledge-lending integration works in practice and raise questions for further research.

	It examines the extent to which an important type of Bank knowledge -- on public expenditures -- informs the design of Development Policy Operations (DPOs). It is hoped that this preliminary analysis can provide the IEG and the Bank with useful lessons as it evolves toward an integrated ""Solutions Bank"" and the twin goals. The analysis is not just retrospective. It also seeks to inform the ongoing and future efforts toward integrating knowledge and lending, Systemic Country Diagnostics (SCD), and the design of DPOs.

Argentina: Basic Protection Project (PPAR), PDF file,"The Basic Protection Project was prepared in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, in the context of increased pressure to expand coverage and accessibility of Argentina’s social protection policies. The social protection system had historically been linked to the formal labor market through contributory schemes (pension benefits, unemployment insurance, family allowances, health and housing insurance coverage). Noncontributory programs—for children, the unemployed, and informal workers—were limited. The project aimed at strengthening and expanding Argentina’s social protection system by supporting expansion of coverage and improving the design of two income transfer programs for the unemployed and families with children.

Ratings for this project are as follows: Outcome was moderately satisfactory, Risk to development outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. This assessment offers the following lessons: (i) The choice of indicators is critical for incentives to be effective, especially when a short implementation time is expected; but the definition of some of the DLIs and the information used to determine their targets were not discussed in detail at appraisal. (ii) This PPAR had to clarify the understanding of “effectiveness,” as it was not made explicit in project documents. (iii) Institutional strengthening of the MTESS statistics area was an important additional aspect of the World Bank’s support, given the peculiar context in which this project was implemented.

Montenegro - Financial Sector Policy Based Guarantee Project, Web Resource ,"This Program Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) evaluates the financial sector
policy-based guarantee (FSPBG) to Montenegro in the amount of €60 million
implemented in 2012-2013. It supported a commercial loan in the amount of €100
million. The FSPBG was prepared by converting the second operation of the
programmatic series of financial sector development policy loan (FSDPL) in the amount
of USD$20 million into a guarantee instrument to respond to the large external financing
needs of Montenegro.
PPAR reviews the performance of this operation based on both IEG and Operations
Policy and Country Services (OPCS) guidelines. The report makes use of program level
evidence and draws broader lessons on the use of policy-based guarantees in the Bank.

Albania Country Program Evaluation, PDF file,"The primary goal of the evaluation is to assess the Bank Group’s development effectiveness in Albania during the period FY11-19 and to inform the design and implementation of its future activities in Albania. The Country Program Evaluation (CPE) will place strong emphasis on assessing World Bank Group strategic positioning and program delivery to help Albania achieve its development goals, notably that of European Union (EU) accession. The selection of Albania is motivated by the important challenges the country has faced since the 2008 financial crisis in sustaining the major development gains achieved following the opening of the economy in the early 1990s. The report seeks to provide inputs for the next Country Partnership Framework (CPF), scheduled for Board discussion in FY21. While the CPE is primarily aimed at informing future WBG support to Albania, the evaluation findings are expected to provide lessons for WBG programs in countries that share similar characteristics and aspirations—for example, other small-size, middleincome countries seeking to achieve high rates of growth and poverty reduction, facing the challenge of employment creation, or aspiring to join the EU.",Country :  Albania,Content Type : Reports,"December 19, 2018

International Finance Corporation Country Diagnostics and Strategies Under IFC 3.0: An Early-Stage Assessment (Approach Paper), PDF file,"In December 2016, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) introduced its latest strategy, IFC 3.0, which aimed to enhance IFC’s development impact by creating “new and stronger markets for private sector solutions” (IFC 2019) and “mobilizing private capital at significant scale” (IFC 2021) where it is needed the most. To achieve IFC 3.0’s aims of market creation and private capital mobilization at scale, IFC recognized it would need new tools and analytical capabilities to: (i) Develop a deeper understanding of the constraints limiting private sector solutions and opportunities in each country’s economy, including in key enabling and productive sectors; and (ii) Allow for a more strategic selection, sequencing, and implementation of its activities and stronger coordination across the World Bank Group. At the country level, IFC 3.0’s tools included a new diagnostic instrument, the Country Private Sector Diagnostic (CPSD), and a new strategy instrument, the IFC Country Strategy. The objective of the evaluation is to assess whether IFC Country Strategies and CPSDs have enhanced IFC’s ability to create markets and mobilize capital at scale and have informed Bank Group collaboration on private sector development.

Empréstimos responsáveis para gastos responsáveis: gestão financeira e de dívida em Países de Baixa Renda, Web Resource,"Uma boa gestão das finanças públicas é crucial para impor disciplina fiscal, bem como para usar os escassos recursos públicos de forma eficiente e efectiva. Eventuais fragilidades na Gestão das Finanças Públicas e Dívida (GFPD) podem ter implicações de longo alcance atinentes ao desenvolvimento, podendo mesmo criar um fosso entre a formulação de políticas públicas e a sua implementação.

Um novo relatório do GAI avalia o impacto dos esforços implementados para promover uma sólida GFPD (esforços que são ainda mais relevantes no pós-Pandemia da COVID-19). Nele verifica-se que um número crescente de Países de Baia Renda (PBR) deparou-se, novamente, com o elevado risco ou está em situação de endividamento.

À medida que os Governos mudam rapidamente as suas políticas e despesas em resposta à pandemia, os sistemas de GFPD robustos, adequados e flexíveis são cruciais para:


	Garantir o uso de recursos escassos de maneira eficiente, visando conseguir o maior custo-benefício e prevenir o uso não autorizado de fundos.
	Acelerar a execução do orçamento e a disponibilização de fundos cruciais destinados aos serviços públicos essenciais e emergenciais.
	Gerir os custos e riscos inevitavelmente associados a um aumento do endividamento num tão curto espaço de tempo.


Crise da Dívida: sensação de déjà vu?

Mesmo antes do início da pandemia, já era evidente um recrudescimento do endividamento nos Países de Baixa Renda, incluindo aqueles que, no passado, haviam sido alvos de medidas de redução de dívida em larga escala. Desde 2013, o número de países elegíveis para o financiamento da AID, isto é, do fundo do Grupo Banco Mundial para os países mais pobres, em situação de alto risco ou já sobre-endividados aumentou mais que o dobro (de 13 para 34), e a média do rácio da dívida face ao Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) aumentou de 40 para 60%. Entre 2013 e 2018, os pagamentos de juros medianos entre os PBR aumentaram 128%. Tudo isso ocorreu enquanto o Banco e outras entidades aumentavam o seu apoio à gestão da dívida.

A gestão das finanças públicas e da dívida são, geralmente, analisadas em separado, apesar de a importância de uma análise conjunta ter sido claramente reconhecida na 19ª Reconstituição da AID:

«O primeiro desafio é prestar assistência aos países abrangidos pela AID, a fim de assegurar que os benefícios (dos empréstimos) superem os custos de serviço da dívida. A AID e outros parceiros podem colaborar apoiando iniciativas que reforcem a capacidade em áreas como a gestão das finanças, o investimento público... e a gestão da dívida» (p.19)

A complementaridade entre os pilares da GFPD está no centro da nova avaliação do GAI, World Bank Support for Public Financial and Debt Management in IDA – eligible Countries. O relatório abrange a década que se seguiu à crise financeira global de 2008, durante a qual muitos PBR aumentaram os seus empréstimos não-concessionais a curto prazo, sendo a maioria conseguida através de acordos bilaterais e em condições de opacidade. Muitos PBR sentiram igualmente o impacto da baixa de preços das commodities e da realização de passivos contingentes, incluindo aqueles associados às Empresas Estatais. O período em questão caracterizou-se, igualmente, por maior atenção para a despesa e o investimento públicos que promovessem o crescimento para colmatar lacunas ao nível de infra-estruturas e cumprir os Objectivos de Desenvolvimento do Milénio (ODM) e, subsequentemente, os Objectivos de Desenvolvimento Sustentável (ODS).

O apoio do Banco Mundial à GFPD: impactante, porém descoordenado

A avaliação verificou que o apoio do Banco aos países elegíveis para a AID para o reforço da GFPD conduziu a resultados positivos, apesar das suas limitações. Também, contribuiu para o lançamento de sistemas de informação de gestão financeira visando monitorar e gerir as despesas públicas, mas teve menos êxito no incentivo ao alargamento dos sistemas para incluir transacções de alto valor. Verificou-se, igualmente, um aumento do número de países elegíveis pela AID, que cumpriam os requisitos mínimos para as várias dimensões da capacidade de gestão de dívida, incluindo a elaboração de Estratégias de Endividamento a Médio Prazo e a análise da sustentabilidade da dívida.

Porém, para a maioria dos países mais vulneráveis, o apoio à gestão de dívida não foi sistematicamente acompanhado ou coordenado com esforços visando melhorar a gestão das finanças públicas, apesar do amplo reconhecimento das sinergias entre empréstimos, transparência fiscal e qualidade da despesa e do investimento públicos. Tal facto é considerado problemático, porque vários PBR estavam a contrair muitos empréstimos a mercados privados e doadores bilaterais para financiar projectos de investimento. Poderiam, assim, ter beneficiado de melhorias nas estruturas e sistemas institucionais, a fim de aumentar a qualidade e eficiência das despesas públicas.

Em resultado disso, as oportunidades de aumentar o impacto do reforço do crescimento de investimentos públicos financiados pelo endividamento foram, provavelmente, desperdiçadas, com todas as consequências negativas para a sustentabilidade da dívida que isso acarreta. O diagnóstico de Gestão do Investimento Público (GIP) foi implementado pelo Banco, em menos de metade dos países elegíveis para a AID, sendo que a procura se concentrou entre os PBR com rendimentos comparativamente mais altos. Dos 32 países elegíveis para a AID em alto risco ou em situação de sobre-endividamento no AF18, apenas 10 receberam apoio à GIP, durante a década anterior.

Visto que a melhoria do impacto de recursos públicos escassos é de cada vez maior relevância, é necessária uma abordagem mais deliberada e coordenada à criação de capacidades no sector da GFPD, se o Banco quiser atingir os 19 objectivos propostos pela AID visando ajudar os países-alvo a assegurar que o fardo da dívida não comprometa a sua capacidade de reduzir a pobreza ou cumprir com as funções essenciais de Governo. A forma descentralizada e descoordenada com que estes diagnósticos foram implementados e usados pelo Banco sugere haver espaço para futuras sinergias, no âmbito dos pilares da GFPD.

O caminho a seguir:

A avaliação recomenda que os funcionários do Banco mantenham uma visão clara e actualizada dos pontos fortes e fracos da GFPD para cada país elegível para a AID, aproveitando as avaliações existentes das principais dimensões do seu impacto. Esta questão já foi abordada dentro dos pilares da GFPD, mas as sinergias entre pilares permanecem sub-exploradas.

Também se recomenda que o Banco apoie de forma mais sistemática as medidas de GFPD nestes países, através de apoio creditício e não creditício melhor sequenciado e complementar. A implementação da nova Política de Financiamento do Desenvolvimento Sustentável e a identificação de performance e acções, neste âmbito, propiciam uma oportunidade para ter uma visão mais holística da GFPD ao nível nacional. No seguimento do choque económico decorrente da pandemia, os esforços para manter um foco mais amplo nos empréstimos e despesas terão cada vez mais importância.

Managing Environmental and Social Risks in Development Policy Financing, PDF file,"This is one of a series of learning products on Development Policy Financing (DPF) being undertaken by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), covering a range of issues. The series provides a timely independent perspective in relation to the World Bank's 2015 DPF Retrospective. This learning product is intended to provide lessons that will help strengthen the DPF instrument in a key area, by identifying opportunities to improve how environmental and social risks are handled. IEG found multiple examples of good practice in managing environmental and social risks. Overall, however, IEG found significantly more actions to have the risk of negative environmental or social effects than were identified by World Bank task teams. The review suggests that several aspects of policy, procedures, and guidance could be strengthened to help the Bank achieve this goal and that incentives and capacity could be enhanced to promote good practice in environmental and social risk management in DPF. Going forward, the inclusion of environmental and social themes and risks in new World Bank tools is a positive step and could be used to focus attention on operations with significant risks and to carry out or encourage upstream analytical work on a country's environment and social capacity, policy opportunities and challenges, and risks.

Mexico - Completion and Learning Review : IEG Review, Web Resource ,"This review of Mexico’s Completion and Learning Review (CLR) of the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covers the CPS period FY14-FY19 and the Performance and Learning Review (PLR) of January 26, 2017. Mexico is an upper-middle-income country with a gross national income (GNI) per capita (in current US$) of US$9,180 in 2018. During 2014-18, the average annual GDP growth rate was 2.2 percent in a show of resilience in the face of a complex external environment. In the first half of 2019, economic growth came to a virtual halt owing to policy uncertainty, tight monetary conditions and budget under-execution as well as slowing global manufacturing activity. Over the longer term, Mexico’s economic growth has been below the level needed to converge toward advanced country economies. The country’s per capita GDP, which is closely related to productivity, stands at 34 percent of U.S. per capita GDP compared with 49 percent in 1980.2 Poverty rates (share of individuals living on less than the 2011 PPP US$1.90 per day poverty line) fell from 3.8 percent of the population in 2016 to 2.2 percent in 2016. There was a small decline in the Gini index from 48.7 percent in 2014 to 48.3 in 2016. IEG’s Country Program Evaluation for Mexico (2018) indicates that Mexico’s multidimensional poverty index for the extremely poor fell from 11.3 percent in 2010 to 7.6 percent in 2016, helping reduce the overall index from 46.1 percent to 43.6 percent. At the same time, income growth of the bottom 40 percent was below the population mean.",Country :  Mexico,Content Type : Reports,"February 13, 2020

The Drive for Financial Inclusion: Lessons of World Bank Group Experience – Approach Paper, PDF file,"Financial inclusion is expected to help address poverty and shared prosperity by improving and smoothing household incomes at the same time as reducing vulnerability to shocks, improving investments in education and health, and encouraging the growth of businesses and related employment. The poor face immense financial challenges. The income of the poor is not only lower but also more volatile. They often rely on a range of unpredictable jobs or on weather-dependent agriculture. Transforming irregular income flows into a dependable resource to meet daily needs represents a crucial challenge for the poor. Another challenge lies in meeting costs if a major expense arises (such as a home repair, medical service, or funeral) or if a breadwinner falls ill. Savings, credit, insurance, and remittances can each help the poor to smooth volatile incomes and expenses, providing a margin of safety when income drops or expenses rise, or providing the needed funds for children’s education or health care. Additionally, financial inclusion in the form of financial services for microentrepreneurs and very small enterprises has been guided by the intention that it can help them to survive, grow, and generate income for the poor. Nonetheless, evidence that financial inclusion directly takes people out of poverty is mixed. The main objective of this evaluation is to enhance learning from the Bank Group’s experience, including the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA, in supporting client countries in their efforts to advance financial inclusion over the period of FY14–20. It both updates and expands on a 2015 IEG evaluation, which assessed Bank Group activity for FY07–13. It not only updates an evaluation of WBG activity in financial inclusion and in support of national financial inclusion strategies, but also plans for a deep focus on the following: (i) A retrospective look at the drive for universal financial access (the UFA 2020 initiative), including outcomes achieved in its 25 focus countries; (ii) Progress and challenges in women’s access to financial services (gender); (iii) An in-depth examination of digital financial inclusion efforts and the role of digital financial services as vehicles for financial inclusion. This work intends to focus more deeply on outcomes on the ground for poor households and microenterprises. It intends to understand the relevance and effectiveness of these activities, including the outcomes and the mechanisms by which observed outcomes were achieved.

Video: Time to Prioritize Pollution?, Web Resource,"A new report released by the World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group calls on countries to direct more resources towards addressing pollution.

IEG found that support from the World Bank Group and other development partners has not kept pace with increasing pollution levels. A recent report in The Lancet found that pollution is the largest environmental cause of disease and premature death, killing nine million people every year -- three times more deaths than from AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.

Two to Tango: An Evaluation of World Bank Group Support for Fostering Regional Integration (Approach Paper), PDF file,"Three overlapping forces shape economic and political systems in the contemporary world order: globalization, regionalism and nationalism. The first wave of regionalism in the 1960-1980 was primarily driven by the trade and tariff agenda, followed by the second wave in the 1980-2000 when regionalism was seen as a useful supplement to multilateralism. Today, in the context of emerging market and developing economies, the new dimensions of regionalism include interactions beyond trade, and can potentially encompasses hard infrastructure, institutional alignments, labor and capital flows. This evaluation focuses on regional integration (RI), which the World Bank Group (WBG) defines as economic interactions across at least two sovereign jurisdictions that are geographically close and resulting in integration of factors and goods, and coordination of policy. According to the 2013 World Bank Group Strategy, transformational engagements are about regional integration, involving both game-changing investments and actions to address policy constraints that require a coordinated response by several countries. Most transformational engagements entail partnerships in which the WBG may play a leading or supporting role.
